# Security

romp runs a local kernel and a local message bus on your machine, and drives
Claude Code sessions on your behalf. This document states the trust model it
assumes, what that means on a shared machine, and how to report a vulnerability.

## Trust model: token-gated, same-user by file permission

Two local services run on your machine:

- the **kernel** (dashboard/API) on `127.0.0.1:29855`, and
- the **postal bus** (inter-session messaging) on `127.0.0.1` (a fixed local port).

Both bind **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1`); neither is exposed to your network by
default. On top of that, **every request requires the serve token — loopback
included** (the model Jupyter uses, for the same reason: loopback is one network
stack shared by every local UID, so it cannot be a trust boundary by itself).

The token (`~/.local/state/romp/serve-token`) is 144-bit random, stored at mode
`0600`, and compared with a constant-time check — **file permissions are the
same-user gate**. Same-user clients (the CLI, hooks, the bus, the VS Code
extension) read the file and send it as an `X-Romp-Token` header; the browser
presents it once as `?token=` (print the ready-made link with `romp url`, or
paste the token into the login page a bare open of the dashboard serves) and
rides an `HttpOnly` cookie afterwards. That cookie authorizes only from an
accepted Origin, which is what protects the browser surfaces — the WebSocket
upgrade included — against cross-site requests. The distinction matters because
cookies are scoped by host and **not by port**: every `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`
page on your machine is same-site with the dashboard, so anything else you run
on loopback (a dev server in a repo an agent cloned) would otherwise ride your
cookie into a live socket. A token presented explicitly, as `?token=` or
`X-Romp-Token`, is accepted from any Origin — that is what federation needs, and
a cross-site page cannot obtain it. The only token-exempt routes are the
no-side-effect liveness probes:
`/healthz`, `/version`, `/busy` on the kernel and `/ping` on the bus.

The practical consequence: another local user on a **shared machine** cannot
reach your kernel or bus — `/send` (which injects text into a live Claude
session that runs tools as you) and bus mail both require a token only your
UID can read.

## Residual cautions on shared machines

- The token gate protects against other **non-root users**. Root (or the host
  operator of a container/VM) can read any file and inspect any process — no
  userspace design changes that. Don't keep long-lived credentials on hosts
  whose root you don't trust.
- **Do not** set `ROMP_SERVE_HOST` to `0.0.0.0` or a LAN address on an untrusted
  network — the token still gates every request, but it widens the surface; use
  an ssh tunnel or `tailscale serve` instead, which keep the listener on
  loopback.
- For defense-in-depth on Linux you can still run romp inside a per-user
  **network namespace** (`unshare -n`) or rootless container, so its loopback is
  not even reachable by other users' processes.

## What is already hardened

- **Loopback-only binds** for the kernel and bus (above).
- **Serve token required on every request, loopback included**: 144-bit random,
  stored `0600`, constant-time compare; Origin gate on the dashboard and the
  WS upgrade. Federated (cross-machine) calls authorize with the remote
  machine's token, carried over ssh tunnels the local machine initiates.
- **Path-traversal guards** on every id/name/message-id that becomes a filesystem
  path component under the mail and outbox roots (`_safe_id`), so a crafted
  reference like `../../etc` is rejected before any path join.
- **No shell interpolation:** subprocess calls use argv lists (no `shell=True`);
  untrusted message text reaching a tmux pane goes through bracketed paste, not
  key interpretation; remote `ssh` targets are validated and argv-guarded with
  `--`.
- **Output sanitization:** model output and message content rendered in the
  dashboard/webview pass through DOMPurify; the VS Code webview runs under a
  strict nonce CSP with `localResourceRoots` limited to the extension's assets.
  While the **Comments** panel is open, pdf.js parses a PDF in a Worker on the
  dashboard's origin and paints each page onto a canvas, with pixels as its
  only sink: no text layer, annotation layer, form field, link, or script from
  the file reaches the DOM. That puts a PDF beside the untrusted files the
  viewer already renders on this origin (markdown through marked and
  DOMPurify, source through highlight.js); with the panel closed a PDF opens
  in the browser's own viewer, as before. The properties that limit this
  (pdf.js is handed bytes, never a URL, so it fetches nothing; the installed
  build has no eval path; only its core is bundled; a size cap and a page cap;
  the browser's viewer as the fallback) are stated under "Security posture" in
  `plans/file-review.md` and checked against the code by
  `ui/webview/file-review-posture.test.ts`.
- **No unsafe deserialization:** no `pickle`, `eval`, `exec`, or non-safe YAML on
  untrusted data.

## Federated messaging: per-host trust

romp can attach other machines so their sessions appear in one dashboard and can
exchange postal messages with yours. Because a message that lands in an agent's
context is a prompt-injection surface, **each attached host carries a trust
level** you set in the network popover (persisted per host):

- **trusted** — full two-way postal, no gating. For a machine you control (your
  laptop, your home server).
- **directed** (the **default** for a newly attached host) — you can send work
  *to* that host's sessions, but its mail to you is **held for approval**, never
  auto-injected. Each held message appears as a needs-you card ("incoming postal
  message from X to Y") with **Approve** (deliver), **Edit** (change the text
  first), and **Deny** (drop) — a human decides before any of that host's content
  reaches one of your agents. This is the safe posture for rented/shared compute
  (a cloud VM, a RunPod box): you can drive it, it cannot drive you.
- **isolated** — no postal at all in either direction; the host's sessions are
  visible in the dashboard but its bus never peers with yours.

The trust unit is the **machine**, not a session on it: any process on a remote
box can write to that box's bus, so trust is set per host. Identity is provided
by the ssh tunnel the message arrives on — no separate signing. The gate is
enforced at the receiving bus's delivery point, so it holds regardless of which
host originated the message.

A **forwarded** message is judged by the more restrictive of two tiers: the
origin's and the forwarding host's. The origin stamp is written by the forwarder
and nothing signs it, so trusting it alone would let any peer claim to speak for
a host you tiered `trusted` and have its mail auto-injected — a `directed` host
could promote itself simply by labelling its cargo. Capping at the forwarder's
own tier means a directed relay stays directed whatever name it stamps, at the
cost that mail from a trusted origin relayed through a directed hub is held for
approval rather than delivered.

The one thing romp can NOT firewall this way is same-machine peers: two sessions
running as the same user share a UID, so mailbox trust between them is policy,
not a security boundary (the enforceable lines are per-UID, from the serve token,
and per-machine, from this trust level).

## Network access

romp makes one outbound request by default: it fetches a public model-pricing
table (`raw.githubusercontent.com/.../model_prices_and_context_window.json`)
every few hours to label context/cost. The response is parsed strictly as
numeric pricing. No telemetry or session data is sent anywhere.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately via GitHub Security Advisories on the
repository rather than opening a public issue. Include a description, affected
version/commit, and a reproduction if you have one.
