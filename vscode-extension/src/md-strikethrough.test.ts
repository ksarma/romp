// Strikethrough must require DOUBLE tildes (the user 2026-06-26): marked's built-in GFM `del` fires on a
// SINGLE tilde, so prose with two "approximately" tildes ("~21 Wh … ~1.5 days") rendered as one big struck-
// through run. The chat overrides the `del` tokenizer to require ~~ (matching GitHub). The override lives in
// ui/webview/md-config.ts (the one configuration the assistant singleton, the viewer, the anchor map and the user-text
// instance share), so this test runs the REAL definition — no mirrored copy to drift — and source-pins that
// render.ts wires it into its marked.
