// KernelPipe durability pins (the user 2026-07-21, roof): a card reply sent while
// the extension's kernel socket was down vanished — the pipe queued it silently,
// then the reconnect branch wiped the queue. These pins hold the fix's three
// pieces in place: (1) queued ops are tagged intent/chatter and intent FLUSHES on
// every reconnect (before the webview reload), (2) the chat + feed panels feed
// pipe state into their webviews, (3) both webviews render the down-banner with
// the held-message count. No ws/jsdom harness for the pipe class, so pin at source.
