// esbuild.js's write step and its failure line, driven against synthetic entries in a scratch dir and, end to
// end, through `node esbuild.js` itself.
//
// The kernel rebuilds the served bundles in place by running `node esbuild.js` and, when that fails, puts the
// last 300 characters of its stderr in the notice that says the UI is stale. Two properties of the script are
// what that path relies on, and both break the same way when a merge imports a package this checkout's
// node_modules predates (the shape of the 2026-08-10 katex failure, which broke every restart's rebuild for a
// day):
//   1. a failed build leaves dist/ exactly as it was. esbuild writes each build()'s outputs as that build
//      finishes, so with the extension bundle built first and the webview bundle second, a webview failure left
//      dist/extension.js rewritten and every webview bundle old: the kernel's cache token (newest mtime under
//      dist/) jumped, every open dashboard got a reload prompt for a build that had not happened, and the drift
//      pass read dist as newer than the sources it had just failed to build;
//   2. the last stderr line names the cause and, for a missing package, the cure. A BuildFailure printed whole
//      ends in its stack through esbuild's transport (`at Socket.emit`, `errors: [Getter/Setter]`), which is
//      what a 300-character tail of it showed.
