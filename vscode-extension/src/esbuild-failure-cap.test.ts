// esbuild.js's failure line is cut to 300 characters from the END, so the kernel, which shows the last 300
// characters of the script's stderr when its in-place rebuild fails, shows the head of the line (what failed,
// what is unchanged) rather than the end of its last clause.
//
// esbuild-build.test.ts pins the line's content and asserts `length <= 300`, but every input it feeds keeps
// the line under 300 before the cut (the longest is 249), so the cut itself was untested: a script without it
// passed the whole suite (the review, 2026-09-06). The line is sized so a plausible one fits whole; what
// reaches the cut is a long error text over a long location path — the text is cut at 120, the path never is
// — and a non-esbuild error's message, which the script does not compose. Both are driven here: the boundary
// (300 fits whole, 301 is cut) over a synthetic esbuild error, a REAL syntax error under a deep synthetic
// directory tree, and a non-esbuild error with a long message.
