// esbuild.js's write step: each output reaches dist/ by rename, so the kernel, which serves /dist/ from that
// directory on other threads while it rebuilds, never sends a truncated bundle.

// The in-place write (truncate, then fill) gave a concurrent GET an empty or partial file for the length of
// the write. For pdf-worker.js, the largest output, the failure lasted past the write: pdf.js answers a
// module Worker whose script fails to parse by disabling its Worker path with a flag it never resets, so
// every PDF opened afterwards failed until the page was reloaded (the review, 2026-09-06). These
// tests interpose on fs.writeFileSync, the one call buildAll writes through, to read the served names in the
// middle of each write; the staging names, the fs-error path and the leftover sweep are pinned beside it.
