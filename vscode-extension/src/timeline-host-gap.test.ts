// The half-row gap at host boundaries is GONE (the user 2026-08-08): remote hosts' lanes no longer
// interleave with local ones in a single shared order, so the boundary said nothing — lanes list out
// uniformly and the quiet "host:" name prefix alone marks a remote session. This pins the uniform
// geometry everywhere a lane y was computed with the old offsets (draw, drag-invert, focus pulse,
// judge band), so the gap cannot creep back into one path and skew the others.
