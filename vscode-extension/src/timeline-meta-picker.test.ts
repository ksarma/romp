// known (the registry). The model+effort picker used to hide BOTH when the model was blank, so a new SDK
// session showed neither (the user 2026-06-26, re-routed from bugs). Effort must show immediately. Source
// pins (no jsdom for the SVG renderer): they fail if the picker reverts to gating everything on the model.
