// Every production bundle is built into memory and dist/ is written only once ALL of them have built.
// esbuild writes each build()'s outputs as that build finishes, so with the extension bundle first and
// the webview bundle second, a webview failure left dist/extension.js rewritten and every webview
// bundle old. The common failure is exactly that shape: a merge imports a package this checkout's
// node_modules predates (pdfjs-dist, 2026-09-06, the first build-required dependency the kernel's
// in-place rebuild could meet). The kernel's cache token is the newest mtime under dist/, so the
// half-written dist bumped it: every open dashboard was told a newer build existed and reloaded into
// the same stale bundles, and the kernel's drift pass then read dist as newer than the sources it had
// just failed to build. A failed build now leaves dist/ byte-for-byte as it was, so "the rebuild
// failed" and "dist is older than the sources" stay true together. Watch mode and the test build
// write directly as before: a dev loop wants each rebuild on disk at once.
//
// Each output then reaches its served name by RENAME, not by a write into it. The kernel serves /dist/
// from this directory on other threads while it rebuilds, and a write into the served path truncates
// the file first and fills it afterwards, so a request in that window got an empty or partial bundle.
// For most bundles that is one failed page load; for dist/pdf-worker.js, the largest output, the
// failure lasts past the write: a module Worker whose script fails to parse makes pdf.js disable its
// Worker path with a flag it never resets, so every PDF opened afterwards failed until the page was
// reloaded, long after the file on disk was whole (the review, 2026-09-06). So each output is written
// whole to a hidden sibling in its own directory (`.<name>.tmp-<pid>-<n>`: the same filesystem, so the
// rename is atomic; a name ending in neither .js nor .css, so the kernel's newest-mtime token never
// counts it) and then renamed over the served name, and a reader gets the old bytes or the new,
// complete either way. Every output is staged before any is renamed, so an fs error while staging (no
// space, a permission) removes the staged files and leaves dist/ unchanged. A staging file an earlier
// run left behind (killed between its write and its rename) is removed once that run's pid is gone,
