"""The judge prompt experiment (plans/judge-prompt-experiments.md): a corpus of transcript endings, arms of judge prompts
run over copies of it with the judge module rebound onto scratch roots, the four measures and a report.

    judge_experiment.py build-corpus --state-root ~/.local/state/romp --claude-root ~/.claude --dest DIR [--per-class N]
    judge_experiment.py run --corpus DIR --run-root DIR --arm NAME[=PROMPTS.json] ... --budget-usd X --claude-bin PATH
    judge_experiment.py label --corpus DIR --run-root DIR --live-state ROOT --claude-bin PATH [--model M]
    judge_experiment.py report --corpus DIR --run-root DIR [--figure PNG]

Every path the experiment writes is under the destination the caller names, and a destination inside a git checkout is
refused: the corpus is the user's own history and stays out of the repository. The corpus builder reads the live state
root and the Claude root as FILES (names, the registry, transcripts, goal stores, override journals) and loads no romp
module against them; each arm runs in a subprocess of its own with the judge module loaded against the arm's scratch
root. Every model call is paid by whoever owns the binary named in `--claude-bin`, which is required, as is a budget on
`run` (`inf` for none): nothing here can tell a real binary from a fake, so nothing runs without both being said.
