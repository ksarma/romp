"""The PR tier POLICY as a pure function for romp-on/romp: the repository owner's rules of 2026-09-08, by
tier and by the AUTHOR's role (replacing the maintainers' text of 2026-09-07 and its seven-day clock).

`evaluate(pr)` takes a PR record (the workflow's fetcher builds it from the GitHub API; tests build it by
hand) and returns the check-run verdict: {"conclusion", "title", "summary"}. No I/O here, ever: the
meaning of the gate lives in this file and in tests/test_tier_policy.py.

Record shape (every key the rules read):
  labels: [str]          author: login         head_sha: str
  files: [path]          (a renamed or copied file appears under BOTH its old and new path)
  files_truncated: bool  (the API lists at most 3000 files; True when the PR has more than it listed)
  reviews: [{user, state, commit_id, submitted_at, dismissed, dismissed_by}]   (state = the ORIGINAL state;
            for a dismissed review the fetcher recovers it, and the dismisser, from the review_dismissed event)
  permissions: {login: permission}   (every reviewer AND the author; the author's role is read from here)
  body: str
  issues: {number: {exists, is_pr, comments: [login]}}   (commenters; bots already filtered out by the fetcher)
  There is no time field: nothing in the policy is timed, so the fetcher records no clock, no check-run
  history and no commit date (submitted_at orders one reviewer's reviews and is never compared to now).

Roles, read from the author's collaborator permission in that map: an ADMIN author is the repository
owner; a write or maintain author is a member; anyone else (read, none, or absent from the map) is a
contributor. The check treats members and contributors alike, so the one role that changes a gate is
admin, and an author whose permission the map lacks is read as a contributor: the stricter gate applies.

Tiers (the owner, 2026-09-08):
  docs / fix     ONE tier under two labels (tests-only is the pre-rename spelling of docs). Merges on
                 green for every author: the check requires no approval; whichever maintainer merges it is
                 the whole requirement.
  feature        By an admin author: merges on green (the owner's features merge straight away). By anyone
                 else: one APPROVED review by an admin other than the author on the current head (the
                 owner looks at a member's or a contributor's feature before it merges). No issue, no
                 waiting period.
  major-feature  For EVERY author, a linked issue that someone other than the author has COMMENTED on
                 (the write-up and its discussion; the opener alone is not a discussion, the maintainers'
                 ruling of 2026-09-07 kept). A non-admin author additionally needs an admin's approval on
                 the current head.
  the guard      A PR touching .github/ or scripts/ci/, the gate's own workflow and code, or whose file
                 listing the API truncated (the unseen files are assumed guarded): a non-admin author
                 needs an admin's approval whatever the tier. An admin author is exempt: the owner may
                 change the gate; the guard exists so that nobody else rewrites it through a PR the check
                 cannot see.
  every tier     A standing CHANGES_REQUESTED by a maintainer (write, maintain or admin) other than the
                 author holds the PR until that reviewer lifts it: an objection is an objection, an
                 approval by someone else does not lift it, only that reviewer's own next word does. No
                 tier has a time-based path. Zero or two tier labels fail.

An approval is a reviewer's STANDING (their latest APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUESTED / DISMISSED review; a
COMMENTED review, which GitHub files one per inline comment, never changes standing) that is APPROVED, by
an admin other than the author, on the CURRENT head. Dismissals are read fail-closed, in both directions:
a dismissed APPROVED never counts, whoever dismissed it (as the PR page shows it; a review dismisses only
once, so were a third party's dismissal ignored, the author could spend it first and lock the approval in
with no way left for the reviewer to withdraw); a dismissed CHANGES_REQUESTED is cleared only when the
reviewer dismissed it THEMSELVES, and a dismissal by anyone else leaves the objection standing, so an
author holding write cannot dismiss a peer's objection to merge on green (the maintainers' ruling of
2026-09-07, kept). A reviewer whose objection someone else dismissed lifts it by approving."""
