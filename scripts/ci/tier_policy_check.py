"""The Tier policy check's FETCHER: reads a PR (or every open PR) through the GitHub REST API with the
workflow's GITHUB_TOKEN, builds the record scripts/ci/tier_policy.py evaluates, and posts the verdict as a
check run named "Tier policy" on the PR's head sha. API reads only - it never checks out or runs PR code.

Trust model, stated once: the workflow that runs this is the BASE branch's copy (pull_request_target), so
a PR cannot rewrite its own gate; the token holds checks:write (to post the verdict), pull-requests:write
(to apply the tier the body declares as a label, T273), actions:write (to re-run the label counter on
that head), issues:read, contents:read and nothing else. The PR body is DATA read through the API, never
executed. Nothing in the policy is timed (the owner's rules of
2026-09-08: the gate depends on the tier and on the author's role, and no tier has a time-based path), so
this fetcher reads nothing for the VERDICT that could time it: no check-run history, no issue timeline for
dates and no commit date; the record it builds carries no time field at all. Its writes are the verdict,
the body's declared tier as a label, and a re-run of the label counter's run on the head (the workflow
runs it lists for that are never read into the record). The collaborator permission is fetched for the AUTHOR as well as for every reviewer: the
policy reads the author's role from the same map (admin is the repository owner; a non-collaborator's 404
reads as "none", a contributor).
A dismissed review's original state and its dismisser come from the issue events API's review_dismissed
event (actor + dismissed_review.{review_id,state}; the reviews API itself only says DISMISSED); a dismissed
review with no such event raises.
The workflow's own job carries a DIFFERENT name so exactly one family of same-named runs exists. A renamed
or copied file is recorded under both its paths, and a listing the API truncated (3000-file cap, checked
against the PR's changed_files) is flagged; the head is re-read at the end so a push during evaluation
raises instead of grading a mixed record. Commit dates are never read.
GITHUB_TOKEN is the GitHub Actions app's installation token, which is what the Checks API's "GitHub Apps
only" write rule admits; the ruleset requiring this check must select the run posted by the GitHub Actions
app (a bare context match would accept any write-holder's commit status of the same name).
The body's tier line (T273, the owner 2026-09-08): outside contributors hold read permission and cannot
label their own PRs, so `Tier: fix` in the body is how they sort one. When a PR carries NO tier label and
its body declares one, the label is applied through the API before the verdict, and the same run grades
the tier it applied; a label already on the PR always stands (maintainers re-tier by relabeling), a body
that disagrees is only mentioned in the summary, and a tier label REMOVED by someone other than the author
(read from the issue events) ends the body's say: the line is not re-applied, a maintainer sets the tier.
A label added with the workflow's own token starts no workflow run (GitHub: events the GITHUB_TOKEN causes
create none, save dispatches), so the "Exactly one tier label" run on the head would keep the count it
read before the label: this PR's newest completed run is re-run through the Actions API, and every later
pass re-runs a counter that concluded failure beside one correct label, so the in-progress race heals on
the next event or hourly pass. A first-time contributor's counter run waits for a maintainer's approval of
their workflows (completed, action_required): said in the summary, never re-run from here.
