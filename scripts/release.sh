# scripts/release.sh [major|minor|patch|X.Y.Z] [flags] — cut a romp release, end to end.
#
# ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH: the VERSION file. The tag is DERIVED from it, always as
# "v$(cat VERSION)", and this script does not accept a tag argument at all. That is
# deliberate: the old interface took the tag and then checked it against VERSION, so the
# two could disagree and the only thing standing between you and a mismatched release was
# a comparison you had to remember to trust. Removing the second input removes the whole
# class of error — there is now exactly one place a human types the number, and everything
# downstream is computed (the user 2026-07-29, who wanted one script that does everything
# and keeps the version in sync with the tags).
#
# It runs the whole sequence, because the steps between "bump the number" and "users can
# install it" were a chain of by-hand commands that were easy to half-finish. Leaving
# VERSION merged but untagged is the worst of those states: main claims a version that
# bootstrap.sh will not install, since bootstrap picks the newest v* TAG.
#
#   1. resolve the target version (a bump level, an explicit number, or whatever VERSION
#      already says) and refuse it if that tag already exists
#   2. if VERSION needs to change: branch, commit, push, open a PR, auto-merge it, and wait
#      for it to land on main  (skipped entirely when VERSION is already correct)
#   3. run the test suites
#   4. the macOS gate (see below)
#   5. tag, push the tag, and publish the GitHub release
#
# Two rules it has always existed to enforce, both easy to get wrong by hand and expensive
# to get wrong in public:
#
#   * The tag MUST be v-prefixed. bootstrap.sh picks the release with
#     `git tag -l 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -n1`. A tag like "0.1.0" matches NOTHING, so
#     the one-line installer silently falls back to main instead of installing the release —
#     no error, just the wrong thing. Deriving the tag guarantees the prefix.
#   * macOS CI does not run on pushes (it is billed even on public repos, ~10x, so it is
#     workflow_dispatch-only). A macOS-only breakage can therefore sit undetected until a
#     user hits it. Releasing is exactly when that matters, so this triggers the macOS run
#     and REFUSES to tag unless it goes green.
#
# --skip-macos exists for the case where you must ship anyway; it is deliberately an
# explicit flag (never an env default) and it says so loudly.
