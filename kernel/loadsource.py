"""load_source(name, path): import a Python file by path under a chosen module name.

Everything under kernel/ is loaded by file path, not installed as a package (the repo runs from a
clone; bin/ holds symlinks with the stable names, and cli/ and postal/ run as scripts through them).
Every such load used to be `SourceFileLoader(name, path).load_module()`. `load_module()` has been
deprecated since Python 3.4, emits a DeprecationWarning on 3.10 and later, and its removal is
documented for 3.15, so this is the one replacement, built from the documented pieces
(`spec_from_loader`, `module_from_spec`, `exec_module`) and keeping what the kernel relied on in the
old call:

- The module is registered in `sys.modules[name]` before it executes, so a module that loads
  another under the same name during its own import gets the same object.
- A name that is ALREADY in `sys.modules` is re-executed into the existing module object rather
  than replaced. kernel.py, judge.py and every test module load `romp_event_model` and
  `romp_judge` by these fixed names, so `km.jd is jd` holds in a test that loaded both, and a
  test's `jd._rebind_state(...)` is seen by the kernel it then drives. The two places that must
  NOT share (sdk_backend's and codex_backend's key imports of session_backend, loaded as
  `romp_session_backend_keys`) already use a distinct name for exactly this reason.
- A failed first load leaves no half-built entry in `sys.modules`.

An explicit SourceFileLoader is required: the bin/ names carry no `.py` suffix, and
`spec_from_file_location` without a loader returns None for a path it cannot map to one.

Loaded by path itself (`spec_from_file_location`, `module_from_spec` and `exec_module` in each
module that needs it); tests reach it through tests/romp_load.py, and tools/perf-bench.py loads it
from its own checkout, so a candidate checkout without this module can still be measured.
