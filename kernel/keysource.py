"""Live API-key configuration, separate from credential retrieval.

The design, in four rules:

* A SOURCE is configuration, not a secret: a static key line, or a 1Password reference
  (``ROMP_API_KEY_REF=op://vault/item/field``) that names where the key lives. Everything that
  needs to KNOW about the key — the Billing picker, status displays, ``romp keyswap``'s listing and
  identity checks — reads the source. Only resolve() ever runs ``op read``, at the moment a Claude
  session launches, an API-key-billed judge call is made, or the model catalog refreshes; the value
  is handed to that one operation and never written to disk or cached for a later one.
* A selected source is AUTHORITATIVE. A file that once carried a key line or a reference keeps
  governing this process: emptying it, removing the line, or making it unreadable is an error the
  operation reports, never permission to fall back to the key the manager started with or to a
  login. That is what makes ``romp keyswap`` a swap — nothing an operator removed can come back.
* Supervised managers (``ROMP_SUPERVISED=1``: the systemd/launchd service) read the FILE only. The
  manager process keeps the environment it started with across every kernel restart, so a key it
  inherited would otherwise resurrect after the operator removed it from the file. A startup key
  the kernel therefore ignores is said once on the log wire (sdk_backend.work_api_key_source).
* ``op``'s OWN credential (a service-account token, a session token) is the one secret that must
  reach the kernel's environment for headless use — and nothing else: claim_op_env() takes those
  names out of os.environ at startup and resolve() hands them back to the ``op read`` subprocess
  alone, so no Claude session, judge child or tmux launch inherits a vault-wide credential. The
  tmux SERVER is scrubbed of the same names — and of a stale ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` — whenever romp
  becomes the op consumer, not only at kernel start (2026-09-06: a keyswap to a reference with no
  restart left both in the server's globals, and every new pane billed the old key).
* An op source selected from the FILE is remembered on disk (``service.env.source``, beside the file),
  so a supervised restart after the reference line vanished still refuses to fall to a login
  (2026-09-06: the memory was process-local and a kernel restart forgot it).

Legacy environment/file keys and Claude login remain supported without 1Password.

    """Atomically select a source, removing competing key/reference assignments.

    Every other line survives byte for byte, in place — the file also carries things like
    `ROMP_PERF=1` and `ROMP_EXPECTED_AUTH`, and a rewrite that dropped them would change the
    manager's behaviour on its next start for reasons nobody would connect to a key swap. The
    key line keeps its POSITION (last assignment replaced in place, any earlier duplicate
    removed so the file cannot disagree with itself); a file with no such line gets one appended.

    Written to a temp file in the same directory, created 0600 with O_EXCL, then `os.replace` —
    so no reader ever sees a half-written file and the key is never briefly world-readable. The
    mode is the original file's, narrowed to 0600 if it granted group or other any access at all;
    a new file is 0600.

    A SYMLINKED env file is written THROUGH (2026-09-04): a dotfiles-managed `service.env` is a link,
    and an `os.replace` onto the link's own name would swap the link for a plain file and leave its
    target — what the operator's repo tracks and what a re-link would restore — on the old key.

    Returns {"path", "old", "new", "mode", "tightened", "lines", "target"} — `old`/`new` are source
    descriptors, so the caller can report their identities without resolving provider credentials;
    `target` is the file actually rewritten (the link's target, else `path`). Raises OSError on a real
    failure (the caller reports it).
