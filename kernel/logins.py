"""Stored Claude logins (T346, the user 2026-09-11: a personal and an enterprise Claude account under one
email, and a session billed to either, the way the Billing row offers Login vs API key).

The registry of the logins a romp install knows BESIDE the machine's own signed-in account, so a session
can be billed to any one of them (docs/reference.md, "Several Claude logins"). One record per login under
STATE/logins/<id>.json, metadata only:

    {id, label, email?, org?, kind?, addedAt, acctDigest?, tokenCmd, refused?, refusedAt?}

`label` is the user's word at add time (romp cannot read an account out of a token, so the label is all it
knows about one it never sees); `email`, `org` and `kind` ("personal" | "enterprise") ride only when the
add flow could read them from the CLI's own record. The credential itself, a `claude setup-token` bearer,
lives WHEREVER the user keeps it and nowhere in romp (the user 2026-09-11): `tokenCmd` is a shell command
that prints the token on demand (a secret manager's read command, a private file's cat: romp never imports or
assumes any store, it only runs the command; the user 2026-09-13), and a session or a judge call billed to
the login gets that command's output in its OWN process environment as CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, the kernel
running the command at launch the way it runs the box's own helper (the environment road, 2026-09-14: a
setup-token through an apiKeyHelper hangs the CLI's request, in the environment it is accepted). Nothing in
this module runs a command, reads, logs or formats a token (token_value hands its caller's runner's value
straight through); a record's availability is its metadata alone (a command recorded, not refused, not a
year old).
