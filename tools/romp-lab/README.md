# romp-lab — a full, hermetic, headless romp you can drive in a loop

The standing capability T106 asked for (the user 2026-08-26): run a COMPLETE romp —
real kernel, real SDK sessions replying on the cheapest usable model, the real
dashboard in a headless browser — entirely in the background, reproduce a reported
behavior by scripting the user's exact flow, and iterate until it demonstrably
matches intent. ui-verify (next door) renders static fixtures; romp-lab runs the
whole stack.

## Hermeticity (non-negotiable)

`lab.sh` exports `XDG_STATE_HOME` into a fresh temp root BEFORE anything loads —
the never-load-romp-modules-against-live-state rule: a kernel booted against live
state reconciles it (resumes turns, spawns writers). Its own `ROMP_SERVE_TOKEN`,
its own free port, `ROMP_KERNEL_NO_OPEN=1` (nothing pops up), headless Chromium
(the playwright cache vscode-extension pins). Live state, live postal, and every
visible display stay untouched. Session content is SYNTHETIC ONLY: invented
prompts, never anything from live transcripts.

## Run

```sh
tools/romp-lab/lab.sh                      # full highlight loop, screenshots + verdicts
tools/romp-lab/lab.sh --keep               # keep the temp root + kernel log for forensics
LAB_MODEL="Haiku 4.5" tools/romp-lab/lab.sh   # pick the reply model (default: the cheapest Haiku the menu offers)
```

The driver (`highlight-loop.mjs`) scripts the user's exact flow through the real
dashboard — create a session from the + picker, drop the model to the lab default,
send a prompt, get a REAL reply, select rendered text, Comment, send, follow up —
and asserts the comment-mark state at EVERY event boundary of the T102 contract:

1. send gesture → the busy pulse latches immediately (before any thread exists)
2. thread-open → no state change (sampled continuously: zero flicker)
3. the reply record lands → the pulse clears to settled yellow
4. a follow-up send → re-latches until ITS reply
5. after → nothing sticks (sampled well past the last push)

Screenshots land in the temp root's `shots/` per phase; the script exits non-zero
on the first divergence with the phase named, so it loops cleanly in a
fix → re-run cycle.

## Phases

The default run drives TWO phases, banner first (it spends no model turns):

- **banner-loop.mjs** (T119) — the reload-banner contract on the real stack: a fresh
  page shows no banner; a dist rebuild (an mtime bump on the lab's own dist copy —
  `ROMP_DIST_DIR`, so live viewers never see it) raises the shell's `#rstale` within
  one heartbeat via the shim's keepalive dv-compare; the prompt latches across live
  pushes (`wsFresh` never retires a build prompt); Reload answers it; and after a
  real kernel kill + relaunch the reconnected page still banners on the next drift.
  `--banner-only` runs just this phase.
- **highlight-loop.mjs** (T102/T106) — the comment-mark contract described above; its
  permanent tail phases: 4c full-text (the rendered thread converges to the complete
  reply), 4d clear-timing (the mark may never read settled while the final answer is
  not visible — T112), and 4e thread-interrupt (T138: the popover's working state
  offers the stop square, it targets the THREAD's own session, the ack is instant,
  the pulse clears on the gesture — no reply record is coming — and the turn ends).
  `--highlight-only` skips the banner phase.

## Cost

A lab run spends a handful of short turns on the configured model (default Haiku)
against the machine's own key — the same key live sessions bill.

## rail-drift.mjs — the scroll-marks invariance assertion (T129)

Under pure scrolling, the transcript rail's notches must never move relative to each other (the
user filmed exactly that, 2026-08-27). `node rail-drift.mjs [--dist <dir>]` renders a synthetic
long mixed transcript over the built bundle (no kernel needed — file:// page, placeholder UUIDs),
scrolls two full round trips sampling every notch per frame, and asserts the second round trip —
the learned regime, after the height cache primes — shows zero pairwise drift (tolerance 1.5px for
style rounding; the pre-fix map drifted 5.7px, endlessly). The first round trip's remaps are
event-keyed cache learning and are reported but not gated. Run it after any change to
contentOffsetFrame, the virtualization window, or the scroll-marks/comment-rail painters.
