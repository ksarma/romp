"""perf-bench — offline timing of the romp kernel's payload builders against a COPY of a state directory.

The live kernel's pusher thread spends most of a core rebuilding payloads: build_session (chat),
build_feed, build_timeline (kernel/kernel.py) and jd.load_goals (kernel/judge.py). This tool imports a
checkout's kernel IN-PROCESS, points it at a state directory copy, reconstructs the pusher's liveness
snapshot from that copy's registry files, and times each builder on real-sized data — with no live
kernel, no restart, no network, no WebSocket. Two checkouts (HEAD and a candidate) run against the
same copy and `--compare` prints the per-benchmark deltas.

Usage (every path below is an example; the copy lives OUTSIDE any repo):

    # 1. copy the state directory, leaving out the SDK venv (hundreds of MB, not data) and the two
    #    credential files the bench never needs
    rsync -a --exclude sdkvenv --exclude serve-token --exclude push-vapid.json \\
        ~/.local/state/romp/ /tmp/romp-state-copy/
    #    transcripts are read from Claude's own directory; for a strict A/B (an active session's
    #    transcript grows between runs) copy that too and pass --claude-dir:
    rsync -a ~/.claude/projects/ /tmp/claude-copy/projects/

    # 2. bench this checkout, then a candidate checkout, against the same copy
    tools/perf-bench.py --state /tmp/romp-state-copy --profile --json /tmp/bench-head.json
    tools/perf-bench.py --state /tmp/romp-state-copy --repo ../romp-candidate --json /tmp/bench-cand.json

    # 3. deltas, A -> B (the header flags any difference in the two runs' worlds first)
    tools/perf-bench.py --compare /tmp/bench-head.json /tmp/bench-cand.json

The tool REFUSES the live default state directory ($ROMP_STATE_DIR, $XDG_STATE_HOME/romp, or
~/.local/state/romp) unless `--i-know-this-is-live` is passed — and even then it never runs the
kernel against that directory: it mirrors the directory to a fresh temp copy (sdkvenv and the two
credential files excluded) and benches the mirror, so the live directory is only ever read. The
mirror is removed afterwards unless `--keep-mirror`.

What is measured. Unless noted, each row is one untimed warm-up call followed by `--iters` timed
calls, reported as ms min/median/max:
  liveness_snapshot      Sessions.live() — the pusher cycle's one liveness read (tmux backend off)
  names_snapshot         _names_snapshot() — the cycle's names-registry read
  discover_cold/warm     jd.discover(now) with and without its fingerprint cache
  build_session_cold:S   build_session for each of the K largest live transcripts with EVERY cache a
                         freshly started kernel lacks emptied before each call: the event model's
                         jsonl / assembly / trailing-record caches and the kernel's parse, chat-fold,
                         path-link and states-fold caches (COLD_KERNEL_CACHES and COLD_EM_CACHES below; a
                         name this kernel lacks is skipped and the report lists what was emptied). Each
                         sample is then checked: the event model's assembly counters must show a full
                         assembly, and the session's own transcript must be present in the assembly
                         cache the sample started with empty — proof it was assembled inside the
                         sample. A sample that fails either is an ERROR, not a number, so a cache this
                         tool does not know about (above or below the parse) is caught instead of
                         quietly warming the row. A serve or fold counted INSIDE a sample is reported
                         beside the row, not treated as pre-warmth: with the cache emptied under its
                         lock beforehand, such a hit can only be on an entry the same build created — a
                         transcript the build reads twice (a peer's, for postal resolution), folded
                         when that file grew between the two reads (a live session's).
  build_session_emwarm:S the same call with only the kernel-side caches emptied — the event model
                         still serves the assembled transcript. The difference to _cold is the parse.
  build_session_warm:S   the same call again with everything cached (an unchanged tab's push)
  warm_all_parses        one _parse() per live session from an empty parse cache (single call)
  build_feed             build_feed with every live session's parse cached (the steady state)
  build_feed_noparse     build_feed with the parse cache empty (the cards-first boot shape)
  build_timeline_bars    build_timeline(with_bars=True)
  build_timeline_skel    build_timeline(with_bars=False) — the lanes skeleton the push sends first
  load_goals:S           jd.load_goals for each of the K largest goal stores
  push_cold_cycle        ONE periodic _push over the fake clients with every cache empty and empty
                         dedup state: the pusher's first cycle after a restart (single call, no
                         warm-up). Reports the full frames' bytes per slot.
  push_connect:APP       _push([fresh client], connect=True) per app after a warming cycle: the path
                         a page load pays (pusher-warmed feed served, no baseline move). A fresh
                         client with empty dedup state for every sample.
  push_steady            the periodic _push over the same clients, repeated; no warm-up of its own
                         (it follows the rows above). Each sample records whether _cached_feed /
                         _cached_timeline rebuilt inside it (they do whenever the 5 s view signature
                         bucket rolls at least REBUILD_MIN_S after the previous build, which depends on
                         wall-clock alignment, not on the code under test); the row's numbers are the
                         samples WITHOUT a rebuild, and the samples with one form push_steady_rebuild.
                         The loop runs until `--iters` no-rebuild samples exist (at most 3x iters).
                         A loop that runs past _DEDUP_REPOST_S (60 s) also absorbs one re-send of every
                         unchanged slot; the per-sample bytes in the JSON show it.
Beside the build_session rows the report prints the git queries the chat build ran per call (see the
tripwire note below); the push rows report bytes handed to each fake client per slot.

How the liveness snapshot is reconstructed, and what is approximated:
  * The SDK backend object is built WITHOUT its constructor (no boot heal, no reconcile thread, no
    key claim, no scope probe): a subclass allocated with __new__ and given only the attributes the
    read-side methods use. Its live_sessions() reads sdk/<sid>.json exactly as the real backend does
    for a session with no running thread (_live_row), so every reg with alive=true is a live row.
  * The state of each row is the last STATE record of states/<sid>.jsonl, verbatim, and the row is
    marked connected — what a running session would report — instead of the dormant mapping that
    turns an in-flight state into "waiting". `--dormant-rows` keeps the dormant mapping instead.
    A running session's snapshot also carries live-only fields (subagents, bgTasks); those read
    empty here. ctxTokens and the context percentage come from the reg's persisted values, as for a
    dormant row. `--all-regs-live` also lists regs with alive=false.
  * The tmux backend is switched off (ROMP_TMUX_AVAILABLE=0, the kernel's own seam) and TMUX_TMPDIR
    points at an empty private directory, so no `tmux` is ever run and tmux-backed sessions are not
    represented. Comment threads (threadOf regs) are skipped, as the real live_sessions skips them.
  * The SDK backend's manager key is pinned empty (dormant rows read auth=login).
  * The session list is discovery's (jd.discover, a 48 h window keyed to the real clock) restricted to
    the live rows, plus — as _alive_sessions does for the builders — every live sid outside that
    window resolved through the long backfill window, so the pick list, the parse warm-up and the
    builders see ONE world. A live sid with no transcript anywhere is listed in the report; a run
    where discovery finds nothing for a non-empty live set is an error (a wrong --claude-dir, a
    registry cwd that does not exist here, or a stale copy).
  * Transcripts are read from Claude Code's own directory ($CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or ~/.claude), which
    the registry references; `--claude-dir` points at a copy or a synthetic one.

Side-effect guards (all reported in the output; a guard whose target a kernel revision lacks is an
error, never a silent skip):
  * The manager control-port variables are removed or poisoned before the import (ROMP_MANAGER_PORT
    is set to a dead port rather than unset — an ABSENT value maps to the default, live, port in
    one consumer; see tests/conftest.py), so nothing this process does can reach the live manager.
  * ROMP_MODEL_CATALOG=off, ROMP_CLI_SCOPE=0, ROMP_CLAUDE_BIN=/bin/false, the service env file
    pointed at a missing path, every ANTHROPIC_* variable removed.
  * Functions that would start a network fetch, a background parse thread, a desktop notification,
    a Web Push or a badge push are replaced with recorders (they are not builders; the push path
    reaches them from _cached_feed and the pricing table).
  * `subprocess` in every loaded romp module is replaced with a tripwire that raises on any spawn —
    except the kernel's own read-only local git queries: `git rev-parse` and `git ls-files`, which
    the chat build runs to place path links, and `git remote get-url`, which names the session's
    GitHub repository for PR links (the pair only — `git remote` also has writing subcommands, and
    those trip). Those run and are counted per build. The kernel caches their answers only for a cwd
    inside a git checkout (on the index and tree mtimes, and the config file's mtime for the
    remote); for any other cwd it re-runs `git ls-files` on EVERY build, so the per-build count
    beside the build_session rows says how much of a sample is spawn time. `--no-git` answers those
    queries as failures instead, for a strict zero-exec run.
  * pwd.getpwnam / pwd.getpwuid are wrapped as counters (nss_lookups in the output): the chat build's
    path-link pass calls os.path.expanduser on every path-shaped token, and a `~name/...` token makes
    glibc consult the name service — AF_UNIX connects to nscd and systemd-userdb, local, not network.
  * Every kernel _atomic_write is checked to land under the state copy; the copy's files are
    fingerprinted before and after so the output lists exactly what the run wrote.

Verification: run once under `strace -f -e trace=execve,connect`. Expected: the interpreter's own
execve, plus (without `--no-git`) one execve of git per counted git query and nothing else; connect()
calls only to AF_UNIX name-service sockets (/var/run/nscd/socket, /run/systemd/userdb/...), matching
nss_lookups in the report, and NO AF_INET / AF_INET6 connect:
    strace -f -e trace=execve,connect -o /tmp/bench.strace tools/perf-bench.py --state ... --no-git
    grep -E 'execve\\(|AF_INET' /tmp/bench.strace     # one execve line (python), no AF_INET line

Not a test (pytest collects test_*.py); tests/test_perf_bench.py drives it against a synthetic state
directory."""
