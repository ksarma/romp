# romp UI — design rules

Repo-wide rules live in the root `CLAUDE.md`; these apply to any UI work.

### Progressive disclosure is the UI's organizing principle (user rule, 2026-07-17)
Every surface defaults to its most COMPACT legible form, and you can always click
to go one level deeper — gist → summary → full mechanics, each level a click. When
adding or changing any UI element, ask "what is the one-line version?" and render
that by default, with the rest behind a keyed expand (state survives re-renders —
`openFolds` / `expandedGroups`). Never dead-end a compact view: if there is more
underneath, it must be clickable. Existing examples: tool heads with inline folds,
collapsed tool-group runs, notice cards, postal/teammate cards, nudge gists,
Task/Agent prompt+report. This is the "Glanceable by default; mechanics one click
away" bullet of the Philosophy, stated as the standing rule for every new surface.

### Font sizes: few, and consistent by information type (user rule, 2026-07-02)
Do not multiply font sizes. Similar kinds of information wear the SAME size — labels
match labels, times match the lines they annotate, section bodies match each other.
Before adding a new `font-size`, reuse one already on the surface; nesting relative
`em` sizes compounds (a 0.74em button inside 0.86em text renders smaller than its
siblings), so prefer flat contexts or compensate explicitly. Triggered by the
follow-up header rendering as a soup of 0.74/0.78/0.9em fragments.

### The accent color is light blue `#9cd2ff` — use `var(--accent)`
The romp accent is light blue `#9cd2ff` (`--accent` in `ui/webview/styles.css`, with
`--accent-fg: #0c1a2e` for text on it). Use it for accent/highlight chrome — selected
toggles, in-progress loading dots, the Fleet pill, focus cues — anywhere you want "the
romp blue." Do NOT use it for STATUS colors, which keep their own meaning: working =
`--st-working-bg` (yellow), blocked/API-error = red, ready = `--st-ready-bg`, compacting =
teal. New accent chrome should reference `var(--accent)`, never re-hardcode the hex.

### Loading/waiting states: show the romp loader FIRST
Anytime something is loading, parsing, or otherwise making the user wait, the FIRST
thing to put up is the romp loader animation — the spinning swirl glyph
(`/media/romp-swirl-glyph.svg`, reverse spin) + the "romp" wordmark + three pulsing
accent-blue (`#9cd2ff`) dots — centered over the waiting surface, fading the instant
real content arrives (event-based; a backstop timeout so it can never trap the user).
It's the boot splash (`_landing` `#romp-boot`) and every pane's loader (`_pane_spin`).
Reuse that treatment for any new wait state rather than a blank, a bare spinner, or
text — a consistent "something's happening, it's romp" beats a frozen-looking screen.
A determinate progress bar is even better *when real progress is knowable*; default to
the loader animation otherwise.

### Buttons must stay click-safe across re-renders, and always acknowledge
The dashboard re-renders on every kernel push (a 0.5–3s backstop, plus an
immediate push per SDK stream event and per hook `/tick`). A control whose action
is hung on a DOM node that a re-render rebuilds gets destroyed mid-click — a
native `click` needs mousedown AND mouseup on the same element, so a rebuild
between them silently drops the click. That is the "had to click it several
times" bug. Every interactive control MUST therefore:

1. **Be click-safe across re-renders.** Never attach the action to a node you
   rebuild. Either:
   - **Delegate** to a STABLE ancestor — the container fetched by id survives
     `replaceChildren()`; only its children are swapped — and key the action off a
     `data-act` attribute. Use the shared helper `ui/webview/actions.ts`
     (`delegate(root, handlers)`), installed ONCE per root, never in a render
     loop. This is the default for HTML lists (chat tab bar `#tabs`, Fleet
     `#fleet-list`). A click whose original target was swapped mid-press still
     bubbles to the stable ancestor, so it always lands.
   - For full-canvas redraw surfaces (the SVG timeline) where threading every
     action param through data-attrs is impractical, **defer the rebuild while a
     pointer is pressed** over the surface and flush on `pointerup`/`pointercancel`
     (event-based, not a time heuristic), so the pressed element survives the
     click. See `ui/romp-timeline-view.js` `draw()`'s `_pointerHeld` guard.
2. **Always acknowledge the click immediately**, before any kernel round-trip —
   so the user never re-clicks because "nothing happened." `actions.ts`'s
   `flash()` adds a layout-safe `.romp-acted` press pulse on every delegated
   activation; a button that posts-and-waits (e.g. feed Nudge) must also disable +
   change its own label on click and self-restore. The error / dialog / result
   follows the acknowledgement; it does not replace it.

Reuse `ui/webview/actions.ts` for any new dashboard control. (`.romp-acted` is
defined in both `styles.css` and `feed.css` since the feed page loads only the
latter.)
