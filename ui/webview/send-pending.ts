// The chat's client-side PENDING SEND (render.ts registerOptimistic / reconcileOptimistic): a composer
// send shows its bubble the instant Enter is pressed and re-asserts it on every push until the kernel's
// payload accounts for the message. The DECISIONS live here, pure, so send-pending.test.ts executes
// them (the repo's extract-for-execution idiom); render.ts owns the DOM and the per-session maps.
//
// An entry has NO LIFETIME. It used to expire after 20 s ("a real send always echoes within this"), and
// the 2026-09-06 audit watched the case that assumption misses: the kernel's own echo was pruned early,
// nothing showed a message the CLI still held for 30 s, and the client's bubble gave up at 20 s — the
// send looked lost, then reappeared higher up. An entry now ends on EVENTS only:
//   - a LANDED user atom carrying the text, placed AFTER the send's anchor (below), that no earlier
//     pending send with the same text has already claimed,
//   - the kernel's NEVER-DELIVERED verdict on it, placed after the same anchor (its dropped-echo bubble
//     takes over, with the copy-to-composer and dismiss actions),
//   - the user's ✕ (render.ts's qx delegate drops the entry).
// A kernel PROVISIONAL (its echo atom, its queued bubble) only COVERS one of ours for the push it is
// visible on — the durable record is the kernel's (a persisted echo, the dropped marking, the fed-text
// guard in prune_live), but if it blinks, ours steps straight back in; a copy seen after the press also
// proves the kernel RECEIVED that one send (`received`, attributed per send like a landing). Nothing here
// reads a clock for a press-time entry: the frame resident at the press is older than the send by
// construction, so its anchor AND its placement floor are recorded by identity; only a LATE stamp (stampBase)
// compares stamps to order events.
//
// THE ANCHOR (2026-09-06 review): every decision is read from the events AFTER the send, never from a
// count of tail events. At the first reconcile after the press the entry records the uuid of the last
// stable kernel event (`at.after`) and the uuids of the user events that ALREADY carried the text
// (`at.seen`: an older identical message, an old echo, an undismissed never-delivered bubble). A
// landing, a verdict or a provisional counts for this send only when it sits after the anchor and is
// not in `seen`. ONE RECORD CAN CARRY SEVERAL SENDS (2026-09-07 review): the CLI takes back-to-back
// sends at one boundary as one user record with a text block each, and the kernel ships those blocks
// (`blocks`); such a record is as many copies as it has matching blocks, and `seen` lists its uuid once
// per copy already spoken for. The old form read the last 30 events and assumed the landing was near the tail — but an
// absorbed atom is placed at its SEND time, so after a gap in pushes (a sleep, a reconnect, a turn with
// many thinking and tool events) it sat far above the tail and, with the lifetime gone, the bubble never
// ended. When the anchor itself has left the resident window (the transcript grew past the wire tail),
// everything resident is after it, so the scan starts at the head.

 *  stamp (`p.late`: the press found no frame — a placeholder tab, still loading) reads a frame that may
 *  already hold this send's own echo or landing, and it used to read them as background: our dashed
 *  bubble sat beside the kernel's echo, or a landed send's bubble never ended (2026-09-06 review, round
 *  3). So a late stamp reads the events' own stamps: an event the kernel stamped at or after the press's
 *  second is not before the send — neither the anchor nor background. Events with no stamp keep the
 *  press-time reading, with ONE exception, the queued bubble (below).
 *
 *  THE QUEUED PRESUMPTION (round 4): the kernel's queued bubble carries no stamp at all — its texts are
 *  the queue's bodies and positions — so a late stamp cannot read which of its copies predate the press.
 *  A late entry therefore PRESUMES the newest `own` copies of its text in the frame (one per identical
 *  send pressed against the same placeholder frame; the caller counts them) are this press's own, not
 *  background: the press just happened, and a copy of the same text that appeared with the first frame
 *  is the one the kernel added at its receipt. Without this, a send into a busy or held session whose
 *  first frame already listed it recorded that copy as background, so the entry never got a position
 *  until the CLI took the text: our bubble sat beside the kernel's copy for the whole wait, and its ✕
 *  would have cancelled the real queued send by body. The presumption's cost, stated: when the kernel had
 *  NOT yet received the send as the frame was built and an older identical message sits in the queue (a
 *  held queue keeps one for hours), that older copy is read as this send's — receipt is presumed, and a
 *  send lost on its way to the kernel hides behind the older copy until the queue moves. That case needs
 *  the same text queued twice around a page load; the double bubble needed only a send into a queue. A
 *  stamp on each queued text would make the reading exact and remove the presumption.
 *
 *  THE CLOCK ASSUMPTION, stated once: the press is the client's clock (ms); the events wear the kernel
 *  host's clock in whole seconds — the echo atom is stamped `int(time.time())` at the kernel's receipt
 *  of the send (sdk_backend.py `send`, before the CLI can see the text), the landed atom by the CLI's
 *  transcript record, at or after that (T237b), and both reach the client as `ts = iso(t)`. The bound
 *  holds when the two clocks agree to the second: exactly for a client on the kernel's machine (the
 *  VS Code webview, the served page there), and for a phone as well as its clock is set. A client
 *  running BEHIND the kernel reads an older identical message stamped inside the skew as this send's;
 *  one running AHEAD reads this send's own copy as background, which is the pre-fix reading. The bound
 *  is confined to the late stamp because that is the only stamp that can meet the send's own records,
 *  and because at a press-time stamp it could only misfire (an identical message that landed within
 *  the press's second would read as this send's). */

 *   - the k-th landing after the anchor retires the k-th pending send with that text, and a landing an
 *     earlier entry took is background (`seen`) for every later entry with the same text — two
 *     identical sends in flight used to both retire on the first landing (2026-09-06 review). A record
 *     of SEVERAL sends (`blocks`) is as many landings as it has matching blocks, so the claims on one
 *     record are COUNTED (this push in `claimed`, for good in `seen`), never booleaned — two sends the
 *     CLI took as one record used to leave both bubbles pending for ever (2026-09-07 review);
 *   - the k-th kernel copy of the text after the anchor — an echo atom no earlier entry claimed, or a
 *     queued copy beyond the entry's press-time count — covers the k-th pending send with that text: it
 *     hides that send's bubble for this push and proves the kernel received THAT send (`received`). A
 *     claimed echo joins later same-text entries' `seen` for good; queued copies carry no identity, so
 *     they are handed out by position within a push (the copies an entry's press listed are its
 *     background). One echo used to mark every same-text entry received and clear every "not confirmed"
 *     (2026-09-06 review, round 3): with two identical sends in flight and one of them lost, the lost
 *     one read "sending…" for good, and nothing could ever mark it.
 *  Identical texts carry no identity of their own, so WHICH send a copy belongs to is attributed by
 *  order, exactly as landings are; the COUNT of confirmed sends is what the kernel's records support.
 *  When the kernel hides a fed send's echo behind a same-text queued copy (its chat dedups by text), a
 *  received send can read "not confirmed" after a drop until a copy of its own shows; that clears on the
 *  next kernel copy, and the error is toward "not confirmed", never toward a false "sending…". */
