// T235's display half: the rail's spend hover reads "1 month" as a ROLLING 30 days (a superset window
// can never read lower than "1 week" again) with "this month" — the calendar figure the bill accrues —
// directly under it; a ledger younger than 30 days says "since <date>"; and a host on an older build
// (calendar `month`, no monthToDate) files its figure under "this month" and is LEFT OUT of the rolling
// row, which then says how many machines it does not count. The strip's cell title carries both rows.
// The kernel half (window math, budget attachment) executes in tests/test_spend_windows.py.
