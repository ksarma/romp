// The warning toasts a page is showing when the reload core takes it (kernel.py _RELOAD_CORE_JS, window.__rompReload
// on every kernel-served page). A warnToast is a DOM element that lives 12 s. The core's restart reload waits for the
// chat pane's pending ships (T272: __rompPaneBusy answers 'upload' or 'held-send') and fires on the next task after the
// pane says the hold is over (render.ts endReloadHoldIfIdle, __rompReload.ended()). The last pending ship's retirement
// is that ending event, and three notices are raised in the same task as it, one task before the owed reload fires:
// the kernel's nack of the ship (the file was not saved, so it was not attached; a message held on it was NOT sent),
// raised just after endReloadHoldIfIdle; the dismissal of the last pending chip (the held message was NOT sent) and
// the ack of the last ship landing on another tab (the held message was not sent), each raised just before it. Nobody
// read them, and the fresh page's loss toast reads shipsInFlight, which the retirement had already emptied. A failed
// attachment and an unsent message went unannounced.
//
// So render.ts keeps the texts of the toasts on screen in THIS tab's sessionStorage (like the scroll record: the
// persisted webview state is localStorage on the served page, shared by every dashboard tab of the origin, and one
// tab's nack must not replay in another) on the core's synchronous pre-reload hook alone (persistNoticesForReload,
// from persistForReload, the function window.__rompPersistForReload names) and the fresh page shows them once, after
// the loss toast. pagehide keeps the scroll record alone: a navigation of the user's own replays nothing, the way the
// loss toast fires once and not on every load. A refusal that reports a state rather than an event is left out (the
// staged sends' "Can't send yet": the session's host is unreachable, or its tab is still being created): the fresh
// page shows that state for itself, so a replay would be redundant at best and stale at worst, and render.ts
// ephemeralWarnToast marks it data-ephemeral for the reading to skip. The record is text only, on purpose: a toast
// has no action beyond its dismissal today, and a future toast with one would replay as its words alone. Pure and
// DOM-free so node --test executes both readings (reload-notices.test.ts); the served scenario is
// tests/test_ship_reship.py NackNoticeSurvivesReload.
//
// One divergence from upstream's module: this fork's reload core keeps a 60 s backstop on the pane hold (kernel.py
// _RELOAD_CORE_JS, the fork's; ledger upstream/2026-09-09-reload-deadline-backstop.md) that hands the pane a release note
// through window.__rompReload.released(), which releasedNotices below reads and render.ts persistNoticesForReload appends
// to the kept list, so the fresh page says why it reloaded over the wait.
