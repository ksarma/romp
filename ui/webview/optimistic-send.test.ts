// A composer send clears the box instantly, but the message only reappears in the chat once the kernel
// round-trips it back as its own provisional. Sending to a busy/slow thread, that provisional could briefly
// VANISH in the server-side echo→landed gap — so a just-sent message looked lost for a beat (the user
// 2026-07-15: "showing up as a provisional message ... and it disappeared"). Fix: a CLIENT-side optimistic
// bubble injected at the tail the moment you hit Enter, re-asserted on every push until the kernel's payload
// demonstrably carries the message, then retired.
//
// Reshaped 2026-08-09 (the user, who watched sends vanish again and suspected the fix was hollow): the
// retire test was a bare substring scan, so (A) a resend — or any short message that substrings an older
// bubble — retired its own entry in the very call that created it and showed nothing, and (B) the kernel's
// own PROVISIONAL copy (queued bubble / "echo:" atom) counted as landed and deleted the entry one-way, so
// when that provisional blinked in the echo→landed handoff nothing was left to cover the gap. Now: a
// per-send anchor makes only NEW landed user atoms retire it, kernel provisionals merely SUPPRESS
// injection for the push they're visible on.
// Reshaped again 2026-09-06 (the send-durability audits): the 20 s TTL backstop is GONE — an entry ends
// on events only (a landing, the kernel's never-delivered verdict, the user's ✕) — and the decision
// moved to send-pending.ts, a pure module this file executes directly (see also send-pending.test.ts,
// which also covers the review's fixes: the anchor replaces the 30-event tail scan, exact text and
// one landing per send, the lost verdict's anchor, the receipt proof that clears "not confirmed").
// render.ts has import-time DOM side effects → source pins for the DOM half.
