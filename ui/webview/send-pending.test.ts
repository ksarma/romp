// Send durability on the client (the 2026-09-05/06 audits). Two things went wrong at once: a send fed
// into a running turn is taken by the CLI at a later tool boundary and placed at its SEND time, so the
// pending bubble at the bottom vanished and the message reappeared higher up with no cue; and the
// client's bubble had a 20 s lifetime, so when the kernel's own echo was pruned early the send simply
// looked delivered. Now: (1) a pending send has NO lifetime — it ends on a landing, the kernel's
// never-delivered verdict, or the user's ✕; (2) the pending bubble is drawn AT ITS SEND POSITION from the
// start — right after its anchor, the last stable kernel event at the press — so the steps that stream
// in afterwards land below it and the absorbed atom, which the kernel places at the send time, replaces
// it in the same spot (T252, the user 2026-09-07: a header plus a button that jumps somewhere and later
// disappears is weird; the first cut's "joined mid-turn" header and the jump/✕ cue are gone);
// (3) every composer send posts a clientDiag breadcrumb (never the text).
// The 2026-09-06 adversarial review then fixed the decision's frame: (4) every verdict is read from the
// events AFTER the send's anchor, never from a 30-event tail count; (5) [retired with the cue];
// (6) the lost verdict shares the anchor; (7) exact text, one landing per send; (8) a connection
// drop repaints once; (9) the bare label is per bubble; (10) the kernel's own copy clears "not confirmed".
// Round 3 of that review: (11) receipt is attributed per send, like landings; (12) the ✕ removes the
// bubble's own entry; (13) a stamp taken late reads the events' own times. Round 4: (14) a late stamp
// presumes the frame's newest queued copy of its text is its own (the queued bubble carries no stamp).
// T252c gave every kernel copy an id; now (15) the id is the CLIENT's, minted at the press and posted with the
// send, so the kernel's copies wear it from their first appearance and nothing is latched by text. And (16) at
// a late stamp an event that NAMES the send (wears its id) is this send's whatever its stamp: the id outranks
// the clock.
// The decisions are executed through send-pending.ts; the DOM half is pinned in render.ts/styles.css.
