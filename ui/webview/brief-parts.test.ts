// Per-paragraph brief ages (the user 2026-07-24). A MULTI-item decision brief writes one paragraph
// per owed item in order (judge BLOCK_BRIEF_SYS 2026-07-21), and the kernel ships briefParts —
// [{id, since}] in that same order, each `since` the ask's own block-event time — so the card stamps
// every paragraph with a live "Nm ago" of ITS OWN ask. The incident this serves: a card re-displayed
// a brief whose go-ahead the user had given two hours earlier; a per-paragraph age makes exactly that
// staleness visible at a glance. Source-pinned like the sibling stall-section test: feed.ts builds
// the card imperatively, so the wiring is asserted over the source.
