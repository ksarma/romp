// T249b (the user 2026-09-07): the recorded scroll snap's frame path. A kernel whose read of a transcript failed
// for one pusher cycle sent a full `session` frame with `events: []` for a session with content; render.ts upsert
// took the empty array as the new transcript (a placeholder flash), and the content frame a cycle later was a
// FIRST build that re-landed the reader through the full-show route. The kernel now keeps its previous build
// (tests/test_chat_empty_build_guard.py); this is the pane's half: a frame that would take a held transcript from
// content to nothing is status-shaped, never a wipe, and is filed once per session in the client-diag journal.
// Executed rule + render.ts wiring pins, red on the previous render.ts. Synthetic ids only.
