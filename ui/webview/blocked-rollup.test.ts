// Blocked rolls UP the goal tree (the user 2026-07-11): nimbus's Needs-you traced to a block buried
// two levels under a collapsed checklist row — the only visible glyph was the open to-do's ring, which
// got misread as the block source. The kernel's flatten now mirrors the judge's any_blocked (every
// non-done ancestor of an open block reads "question"; a completed subtree's block stays moot) and marks
// rolled-up ancestors qderived, so the client can show the ⏸ on a collapsed row while pointing DOWN to
// the real ask — and keep the surgical Done/Follow-up buttons OFF the ancestors. Rollup semantics are
// exercised in tests/test_kernel.py (build_feed tree); these are the wiring pins (render.ts precedent:
// no jsdom harness for feed.ts).
