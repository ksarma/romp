//      The rail shows just "11:03"; the date opens a divider above the turn (see dayDividerFor).
//   2. Same minute AND same day as the previous timed turn → suppressed (""), so a run of
//      same-minute events (11:03, 11:03, 11:03, 11:04) shows the stamp only when it changes.
//   3. Otherwise → "HH:MM".
// `hm` is the bare "HH:MM" regardless of the rule, so a suppressed turn still carries the
// time the sticky rail stamp reads when that turn is the one at the top of the view.
