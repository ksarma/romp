// A "Previously attached" row that only remembers a mail-trust tier must SAY so (the user
// 2026-08-12): a hub's known row for a spoke — a tier set in the relay era, no tunnel ever
// attached from that machine — rendered as "Previously attached", which reads as a past ssh
// session that never happened. The kernel stamps `attached` on the attach/detach/check-in
// writers (_known_note attached=True; trust-only writers never touch it), and BOTH popover
// copies split the row treatment on it: label, tooltip, and the button (Attach, not Re-attach).
// Pinned in both copies per the net-trust-pending discipline.
