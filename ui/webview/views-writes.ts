// a writeId, and the kernel answers it on the same socket with {tagEditAck|viewsAck, writeId, ok,
// views, error?, refused?}. The optimistic copy a gesture showed clears on that ACK — an event —
// never on a count of frames: a frame that does not echo the edit says nothing about it (it may
// predate the write, or the kernel may have refused it), and the three-frame yield this replaces
// dropped good edits and kept refused ones alike. Pure, shared by render.ts (the tab strip) and
// mirrored by hand in ui/romp-timeline-view.js (which cannot import TS).
