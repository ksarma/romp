// Per-thread auto-retry suppression on interrupt (the user 2026-07-06): the global "Stop all auto-retries"
// only stops romp's own 10s loop and is account-wide + flap-prone. Interrupting a stuck thread is the real
// per-thread off-switch — the interrupt aborts the CLI's in-flight retry, and status.retrySuppressed keeps
// romp from re-firing "retry" into it until a successful turn re-arms it. The chat renderer has no jsdom
// harness, so pin the wiring at source. (Kernel side: tests/test_session_retry_suppress.py.)
