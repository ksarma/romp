// The interrupt's whole arc is immediately responsive (the user 2026-07-02). Click the stop button →
// the CHIP flips to Interrupting… on the spot and the button + timer REMOVE themselves (the user
// 2026-07-05: the old ack stuffed the word "interrupting…" INTO the fixed-width button, overflowing
// onto the elapsed timer — the "4m 1interrupting…" screenshot; the chip, not the button, owns the
// state); the kernel's push then rebuilds the statusline in that same shape until the stop settles on
// disk and the chip reads READY again. The CLI's "[Request interrupted by user]" stop record renders
// as a slim rail marker in the compact-divider's language — never a person-blue bubble. Source pins.
