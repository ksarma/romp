// The modal's "Done" on a sub-goal acknowledges INSTANTLY (the user 2026-07-23, for whom it felt very
// slow). It used to post and paint nothing, so the tick waited on a goal-store write, a rollup and a
// full feed rebuild — while Drop and Check status beside it already acknowledged on click.
//
// Two properties matter beyond "it paints early", and both are pinned here:
//   1. the optimistic state is STICKY, not a one-shot DOM edit. The feed re-renders on every kernel
//      push, and a push already in flight when the click happened still carries the OLD tree, so a
//      one-shot paint would flip the tick straight back off.
//   2. it can be WRONG, and then it must say so. A cross-off that quietly un-crossed itself a second
//      later would be worse than the slow version it replaced.
// Source pins (no jsdom for the feed renderer), as with the other feed-* tests.
