// The file-path matcher the chat's transcript links are made from, as a module ANY pane can import
// (plans/file-review.md, Slice 0). It lived inside render.ts, the chat's entry, which exports nothing —
// so the Waiting-on-you pane, an iframe of its own, rendered a todo's detail path as plain text while the
// chat's card for the same todo linked it. Lifted, not copied: one regex, one set of gates, one span
// shape, so the kernel's tokenizer parity (tests/fixtures/path_token_parity.json) and the chat's link
// behaviour have a single source.
//
// This module MATCHES and MARKS; it binds no action. Every link it emits is a `.file-uri-link` span
// carrying data-act="openpath" (PATH_LINK_ACT), data-path (what a click opens — for a shortened mention
// the kernel's fixed target, not the token), data-rel="1" when the token was a bare path rather than a
// file:// URI (so a resolver uses a session's cwd), and data-sid when the caller named the session the
// text belongs to. What a click DOES is the hosting document's call: render.ts binds openPath per span
// (the editor in VS Code; the viewer, or the shell's relay, on the web) and paints its figure previews
// from the hits; waiting.ts routes the act through its delegate to the shell's viewFile relay. The
// listeners this module puts on a span are about focus, not the action: Enter or Space on a focused link
// clicks it, so the host's click handler is reached from the keyboard too (pathLinkKey, below), and a
// mouse press does not focus the link, so a click leaves focus where a click on plain text leaves it
// (pathLinkPress / pathLinkRelease, below). A document that cannot act on a click should not call this —
// a link that does nothing is worse than text (ui/CLAUDE.md, every control acknowledges).

// into the message box (render.ts, the user 2026-06-26) — and the viewer a click opens takes no focus, so
// after Escape closed it the next Enter found the link still focused and opened the file AGAIN instead of
// the message box; a selection dragged FROM a link met the same fate on Enter, re-opening the file rather
// than seeding the quote, and in Chromium the focus change itself ended that drag's selection before it
// began (2026-09-06). So a mouse press does not focus the link at all: the browser focuses the span as the
// mousedown's default action, run after its listeners, so the press drops the tabindex attribute — a span
// without one is not focusable — and focus lands where a click on plain text puts it, the body, as
// before, with the click and the selection the press starts untouched. The attribute comes back on the
// events that end the press on this span: mouseup (a click), mouseleave (a drag that goes on elsewhere),
// contextmenu and dragstart (a menu or a native drag took the pointer, and the mouseup may never reach
// the page). Between them the link is out of the tab order, for the length of a press; a keyboard focus
// meets no press and stays — Enter and Space then activate, as an <a> does. Not mousedown.preventDefault(),
// which would also keep a selection from starting on the link (the text is meant to be selectable in
// place); not a blur on the focus event, which in Chromium clears the selection the press made (a

// sticky regexes cut from the one source, and remembers what a failure PROVES about the positions ahead:
//   - the path arm `[~.\w\-]*\/[~.\w\-/]*[\w\-]` failing at i fails at every later position of the same

//     same run of [\w\-.] characters — the dot-then-alphanumeric it needs is drawn from a smaller suffix;
//   - the URI arm starts only at an f or F, and its `file:` cannot lie inside either run (a colon is in
//     neither class), so a dead run's positions are tried for it as cheaply as any other.
// Each arm therefore scans a run at most once beyond its matches in it, and the text costs time linear
