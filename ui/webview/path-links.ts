// The file-path matcher the chat's transcript links are made from, as a module any surface can import. It
// lived inside render.ts, the chat's entry, which exports nothing, so the file viewer (file-view.ts), which
// shows text with paths in it, could reach the matcher only by copying it, and two copies drift. Lifted, not
// copied: one regex, one set of gates, one span shape, so the kernel's tokenizer parity
// (tests/fixtures/path_token_parity.json) and the chat's link behaviour keep a single source. The viewer runs
// the same walk with options (PathLinkOptions, below) rather than a matcher of its own.
//
// This module MATCHES and MARKS; it binds no action. Every link it emits is a `.file-uri-link` span
// carrying data-act="openpath" (PATH_LINK_ACT), data-path (what a click opens — for a shortened mention
// the kernel's fixed target, not the token), data-rel="1" when the token was a bare path rather than a
// file:// URI (so a resolver uses a session's cwd), and data-sid when the caller named the session the
// text belongs to. What a click DOES is the hosting document's call: render.ts binds openPath per span
// (the editor in VS Code; the viewer, or the shell's relay, on the web) and paints its figure previews
// from the hits; waiting.ts routes the act through its delegate to the shell's viewFile relay. The
// listeners this module puts on a span are about focus, not the action: Enter or Space on a focused link
// clicks it, so the host's click handler is reached from the keyboard too (pathLinkKey, below), and a
// mouse press does not focus the link, so a click leaves focus where a click on plain text leaves it
// (pathLinkPress / pathLinkRelease, below). A document that cannot act on a click should not call this —
// a link that does nothing is worse than text (ui/CLAUDE.md, every control acknowledges).

// Enter would find the link still focused and open the file AGAIN instead of the message box; a selection
// dragged FROM a link would meet the same fate on Enter, and in Chromium the focus change itself ends that

// (a span without one is not focusable) and focus lands where a click on plain text puts it, the body, with

// starting on the link (the text is meant to be selectable in place); not a blur on the focus event, which in

// PROVES about the positions ahead:
//   - the path arm `[~.\w\-]*\/[~.\w\-/]*[\w\-]` failing at i fails at every later position of the same run of
//     [~.\w\-/] characters: the first slash it can reach from there is the same one or a later one, and the

//     run of [\w\-.] characters: the dot-then-alphanumeric it needs is drawn from a smaller suffix;
//   - the URI arm starts only at an f or F, and its `file:` cannot lie inside either run (a colon is in

// slash-less filename with a known extension marks too; only FENCED <pre> blocks, text already inside a link
// and text inside an inline SVG (DEAD_TEXT) are skipped. Text nodes only: an element the caller already made

// `pathLinks` (the user 2026-08-09): the kernel's verdict on every path-shaped token in this text
// (build_session's _path_links — tier 1 exact stat, tiers 2/3 a unique repo-list match that FIXES a
// shortened mention to its real file). When the map is present, a token links ONLY if it's in the map,
// and it opens the map's value — so `render.js` in prose stops 404ing, and hover shows the real target.
// Every shape gate still applies; the map only ever narrows. No map at all (an old kernel, a cached
// payload, a surface the kernel never judged) keeps shape-only linking. file:// URIs are explicit absolute
// paths — never gated on the map. Returns the hits in document order, so a caller's "first mention" is the
// walk's first.
