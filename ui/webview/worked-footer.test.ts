// The "worked …" footer's rule and the tail path's footer plan (worked-footer.ts, 2026-09-06). The chat's tail
// path re-renders exactly the events the kernel names as changed, so the one render that depends on later
// events — the footer on a turn's last reply — is patched from this plan. Synthetic events; epochs are seconds.
