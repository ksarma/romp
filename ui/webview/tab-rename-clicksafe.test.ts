// Tab rename must act on the CURRENT tab node, never one captured when the menu opened (the user
// 2026-08-08: "right-click → Rename does nothing; the second try works"). The context menu lives on
// document.body and survives kernel pushes, but the tab it was opened FROM does not: renderTabs()
// replaceChildren()s the strip on every push and nothing defers rebuilds while a menu is open. So by
// the time Rename was clicked, the closure's tab/label were usually detached — startTabRename hid the
// orphan's label, inserted an input nobody could see, and focus() was a silent no-op. Worse, the failed
// call still set renameActive = true, and the only code clearing it sits on that detached input's
// Enter/Esc/blur handlers, which can never fire — freezing the strip's re-renders, which is exactly why
// the SECOND attempt always worked (its captured node could no longer be destroyed) and the freeze then
// healed itself on commit. The fix is this codebase's standing click-safety rule: key the action off the
// id and resolve the node at action time.
