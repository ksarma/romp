// distilled summary far back in a long session, waited, and asked for at least a progress bar). On the index
// wire the reveal is a fetch-until-resident loop: scrollToAnchor asks loadOlder for the chunk before the
// resident tail, chatHead prepends it, the re-land finds the anchor still further back and asks again, until
// the anchor's event is resident. The loop itself is what the one-round-trip window (T323 stage 4b) retires;
// until then, this module says how far along it is, honestly.
//
// Pure: the fraction and the words. render.ts owns the state machine (revealProgressTick) and the DOM.
