// Fenced code, dressed the same wherever it renders: the per-line rows that make a soft-wrap read distinctly from a real
// newline (the user 2026-06-16) and the automatic Copy button (the user 2026-06-22). The chat's highlight() (render.ts)
// and the file viewer's mdBlock (file-view.ts) both call these. The module exists because the two functions lived
// module-private in render.ts and file-view.ts cannot import render.ts: render.ts imports file-view.ts, and the feed
// bundle must not carry the chat. They moved here as they were; the chat's behaviour is unchanged.
//
//   - wrapLinesHtml is the pure walk: highlighted HTML split into lines, each wrapped in
//     `<span class="cl"><span class="ct">...</span></span>`, an hljs span that straddles a newline re-opened on the next
//     line so the markup stays valid. The NEWLINES ARE DROPPED: a row stands for its line and the CSS counter on .cl
//     draws the number. Copy never reads the rows: its caller hands addCopyBtn the text to copy, settled before the
//     rewrite. For the chat that is the code element's textContent as captured (render.ts highlight); for the viewer it is
//     the fence's text as the FILE holds it (fence-source.ts: marked expanded the file's leading tabs to spaces before the
//     textContent existed), the captured textContent only for a fence the module does not find in the file.
//   - wrapCodeLines applies it to a code element and writes the digits of its last line number on the element
//     (`--ln-digits`): the sheets' gutter basis reads it, so every row of a 10000-line block carries a five-digit gutter
//     and the text column stays one line, where a basis a single row outgrew widened that row alone.
//   - addCopyBtn parks a Copy button top-right of the <pre>, idempotent (a re-render can run it again), copying the text
//     it was given: the on-screen textContent lost its newlines to the wrap and is not copy-safe.
//   - copyText: the async Clipboard API with a hidden-textarea execCommand fallback.
//
// The Copy button's action stays on the button. Delegating it to a stable ancestor would change nothing for the one way
// a press on it is lost, a surface that REPLACES the fence while the pointer is down: a pressed node removed before the
// mouseup dispatches no click at all, to the button or to any ancestor. The chat does that with no gesture behind it: a
// card re-renders on a kernel push, and a press on its fence's Copy can be under way when it does. The viewer's fences are
// replaced only by the reader's own clicks (the Rendered/Raw toggle rebuilds the body, Reload the whole viewer), which
// cannot overlap a press, but can fall between a press and the clipboard's answer. On this fork a reload landing with no
// gesture behind it (the Comments panel's poll after a session's write) can also replace the viewer's fences under a press;
// file-view.ts holds that landing through actions.ts pressHold until the release (file-view-copy-held-browser.test.ts).
// Two things follow:
//   - A KEYBOARD press has the same window: a button's Space activation is native to the keyup (Enter's to the keydown),
//     so a rebuild between the keydown and the keyup took the focused button and the keyup clicked nothing. Space acts on
//     the KEYDOWN here, as Enter does, with the key's default prevented on the keydown (the button is never put :active
//     by the key, so its keyup dispatches no click) and on the keyup; a held key's repeats copy nothing more.
//   - The acknowledgement (the label reads Copied, or Copy failed, for about 1.2s) goes to the button ON SCREEN at the
//     fence, not to the node the click closed over: the Clipboard API answers asynchronously, a rebuild inside that window
//     swaps the fence and its button out, and a label written to the pressed node showed on nothing while the copy itself
//     had succeeded. The fence is known by its SOURCE, the text its Copy copies: the button acknowledged is the one of the
//     fenced block with the pressed fence's source under the nearest ancestor still in the document (the ancestors are
//     read at the press, while the button is in the document), and a swap inside the window carries the label to the
//     button that replaced it on the swap's own event (a MutationObserver on the ancestors' child lists, alive for the
//     window). Of several fences with that source, the one at the pressed fence's ordinal among them, so a rebuild that
//     put a fence above the pressed one, or removed the pressed one, never marks a neighbour. A fence the swap did not
//     bring back, its text rewritten or the fence removed, has nothing to write on: the clipboard holds the text and no
//     button on screen claims it; a surface swapped out whole (the viewer closed or replaced) is nothing to acknowledge
//     on, so the walk stops under document.body. code-block.test.ts runs both over a DOM stand-in.
//
// The sheets: the chat's unscoped `pre code .cl` / `.ct` / `.code-copy` rules (styles.css) and the viewer's scoped
// `.fileview-md` copies in styles.css and feed.css (the feed page loads only feed.css), byte-equal (code-block.test.ts,
// fileview-parity.test.ts).
