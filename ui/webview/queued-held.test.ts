// T262i: a kernel queued copy that left the queue frame before its landed record arrived is HELD in place, marked
// landing, until the atom carrying its id arrives; an id-less copy is held by text for one push; never a phantom.
// The follow-up (the first review's reproductions): a copy judged against the PREVIOUS push's anchor, so one that
// vanishes and lands in the same push is released; a landing that releases a sibling is not a "later" landing; a
// copy the user cancelled here, or one that vanished on a settled session, is never held; copies count per text.
// The fields are the wire's (send-pending.ts, the kernel): a queued copy's `sendId`, a landed record's `sendIds` — upstream's
// qid/qids renamed at the 2026-09-09 fold (ruling 4: one vocabulary, no translation seam at render.ts's call site); every
// assertion below is upstream's, re-aimed to those names.
