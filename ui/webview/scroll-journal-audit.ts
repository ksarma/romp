// Reading the scroll journal for the move nobody wrote (T262k, the user 2026-09-08). For most of a day the chat
// transcript snapped away from where the reader had put it: a single scroll event, 0.1–2.7 s after they reached the
// bottom (or right after a land), read a scrollTop tens of pixels above the bottom — the same value every time for a
// given tab — with no "scrollwrite" row, no "tailchange" row, and scrollHeight unchanged at the read. Six such moves in
// five minutes of one capture; the go-to-bottom chip appeared after each. Every capture was read by hand.
//
// This module is that reading, as code, so the fingerprint is recognizable from the rows alone and a recurrence is a
// function call away from any journal (the laptop's client-diag.jsonl, a kernel-side check, a test fixture). It is
// pure and DOM-free; it consumes the rows the pane files through scroll-write.ts (scrollWriteRow, tailChangeRow,
// spacerRow, and the scroll listener's gesture row) and answers two questions:
//
//   unwrittenMoves(rows)    — which scroll events moved the view without a write to explain them? A move is a
//                             "scrollgesture" row whose top differs from the last recorded position by at least
//                             `minPx`, arriving at least `idleMs` after that position was recorded (so it is not the
//                             next sample of the reader's own burst) and with no further gesture within `settleMs`
//                             after it (a reader's burst continues; the snap is one event). Each move says whether a
//                             tail-height change or a spacer re-size filed since the last position accounts for its
//                             size (Chrome clamps a bottom reader when the tail shrinks and carries them along when
//                             a spacer above re-sizes — both legitimate, both unwritten) or nothing does.
//   repeatedLandings(moves) — which landing values recur? The snap's signature was one fixed value per tab.
//
// Limits, stated so a quiet result is read correctly: a move inside a gesture (the snap landed mid-burst once) is not
// separable from the burst by position alone and is not reported; a reader's single fast flick after a pause is
// reported as a move with `explained: "none"` — repeatedLandings tells the two apart, since a flick lands anywhere. A
// scroll event read while the view has nothing to scroll (scrollHeight <= clientHeight: a view emptied for a rebuild
// clamps to 0) is neither a move nor a position; the rebuild's own land is the next position.
