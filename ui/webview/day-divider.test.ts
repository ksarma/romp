// The day divider (the user 2026-08-01). A day boundary used to stack its date on its own row
// INSIDE the 47px-wide rail marker; "Yesterday" measures 52.6px bold at the default 13px, so the
// pane's overflow:hidden ate its leading "Y". Sizing the label to fit that gutter is not a fix —
// `--fs` follows --vscode-chat-font-size, so a larger chat font re-clips whatever just fit at 13px.
// The date moved to a full-width divider in the prose column, where no date string can be cut off.
//
// Two invariants worth pinning, both of which a refactor could quietly break:
//   - the divider is a SIBLING before the turn, never a child of it. .dot and .time-marker are
//     absolutely positioned against the TURN's top edge, so a divider inside the turn would push
//     the message down and strand the dot up beside the rule.
//   - every append path emits it. The windowed rebuild and the incremental tail append are separate
//     code paths; when only one had it, scrolling back rebuilt dividers that live appends had dropped.
// The chat renderer has no jsdom harness, so — like render-rail.test.ts — pin at the source.
