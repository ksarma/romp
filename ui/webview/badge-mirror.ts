// Card trouble badges mirror into the shell's notification bell (the user 2026-07-27): anything that
// shows as a problem chip on a card — a judge warning, a failed follow-up, an API-error block, a
// retry storm — ALSO logs one entry in the bell, so problems are findable in one place after the
// fact. The chip on the card stays exactly as it was; the bell entry is the durable copy of the
// moment it appeared.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT MIRRORED: the stalled hold. A stall is romp's nudge gate waiting out one of its
// own revivers (a judge call mid-flight, a reply still being judged), and almost every episode ends
// in seconds — the judge rules, or the auto-nudge fires and the session picks the work back up.
// That is the machinery working, not a problem, and mirroring it filled the log with "stalled" rows
// for holds nobody ever saw on a card (the user 2026-07-29). The chip on the card is the live
// surface; a stall that actually defeats the nudge escalates to nudgeFailed, which logs below.
//
// Pure: the caller passes the previously-notified signature set and gets back fresh notices + the
// now-active set. A signature keys the EPISODE (card + kind + the badge's own since/t), the same
// event-identity idea as the limit/judge signatures: per-push re-renders and page reloads don't
// re-log, a badge that clears leaves the active set (so a recurrence logs afresh), and a NEW episode
// of the same kind (different since/t) is a new entry.
