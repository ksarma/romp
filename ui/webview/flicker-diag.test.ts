// The flicker tripwires (the user 2026-07-31): cards were blinking in and out of the feed and NO
// surface recorded it — the colflip trail only logs column CHANGES, the connection layer logged
// nothing, and the restart doors were anonymous. Three breadcrumb layers now write the same
// client-diag journal (client-diag.jsonl), so the next blink is attributed from the recorded trail:
//   feed itemset   — which itemIds entered/left the MODEL between renders (payload-level);
//   feedmerge      — each host's contribution to the merged feed whenever a count changes;
//   hostconn       — every remote socket open/close/detach.
// Plus the manager logs every /restart request with its source. Source pins (the wiring has no
// jsdom/ws harness here), like the colflip tripwire's own pins.
