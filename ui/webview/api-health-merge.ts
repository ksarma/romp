// script (kernel.py _LANDING_APIH_JS) reaches them through window.__rompApiHealthMerge (api-health-global.ts).

// in its longest window) and `errs` (failed attempts in it), rebuilt every cycle and pushed on change, so the dot
// changes on the kernel's events and never on a history reading the browser took at some earlier hover. The
// readings only word each machine's line in the popup.
