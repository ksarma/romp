// The API-health signal on the shell's rail, across EVERY connected kernel (T301, the user 2026-09-10): the
// merge of the per-host frames into the one dot, the plain-words reading of one kernel's /api-health document,
// and the merge of several such documents. Pure (no DOM), so the rules are unit-tested; the shell's inline
// script (kernel.py _LANDING_APIH_JS) reaches them through window.__rompApiHealthMerge (api-health-global.ts).
//
// The federation rule holds throughout: per-host MAPS in, per-host lines out; nothing here adds a count from
// one kernel to a count from another or compares two kernels' clocks. "Worst state wins" is a comparison of
// STATE WORDS, which are the same vocabulary on every kernel.
//
// The dot follows the FRAMES alone (review find, 2026-09-10): each kernel's frame carries `quiet` (no API event
// in its longest window) and `errs` (failed attempts in it), rebuilt every cycle and pushed on change, so the dot
// changes on the kernel's events and never on a history reading the browser took at some earlier hover. The
// readings only word each machine's line in the popup.
//
// T316 (the user 2026-09-10, the design follow-up): a machine's line is its COUNTS over the popup's window, each
// class in its own colour (successes in the accent, 429 in the blocked red, 5xx in the 5xx magenta, no connection
// and other statuses in the other band's hue, T340), never a verdict word; the window is the ledger's 24 hours when the kernel
// serves one, else the document's longest window; the histograms are stacked bars from the ledger's tiers.
