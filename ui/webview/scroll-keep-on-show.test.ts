// T249 (the user 2026-09-07, a screen recording): on a session served through the relay from an attached
// kernel, the chat pane snapped the reader's scroll back to an earlier position ~3 s after they scrolled to
// the bottom — the exact spot the tab had been left at, a blue bubble at the top of the viewport.
//
// The writer: landActive's closing rule, `if (!v.shown || v.stick) bottom else v.scrollTop`, fed by a saved
// spot nothing updated while the reader scrolled (only a tab switch's leaving-tab save, the jump button,
// the resize compensation and the nav trail wrote it). Any full show of an already-shown tab — a
// fork/first-build frame, a settings rerender, a revive failure, a dismissal's fallback — landed the reader
// on that stale spot. Fix: (1) the #content scroll listener keeps the active view's saved spot and
// follow-mode current; (2) a show of a view already on screen anchors the reader's place across its rebuild
// like the live append does, and the big-view re-collapse-to-tail is a switch-only rule. Review folds
// (2026-09-08): a DEFERRED build's reveal clamps the scroll and fires a scroll event before the build lands,
// so nothing is recorded while a build is pending (else a compact-mode switch to a tab with an unbuilt update
// landed at the bottom, not its saved spot); rerenderAll captures the reader's anchor before it empties the
// DOM and hands it to showActive; a live seek counts as navigation. Executed rules + render.ts wiring pins,
// red on the previous render.ts. Synthetic values only.
