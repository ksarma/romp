// The chat page's hidden word for the kernel's pane shim. The shim gates its stale banner on paneHidden(): a pane
// the user cannot see never raises it (the 2026-08-15 phone fix, where every hidden pane's throttled watchdog
// raised the banner over a working dashboard). The shim's own witness is the zero-viewport probe, which in Chromium
// is right only for a pane hidden SINCE LOAD: a display:none iframe keeps the size of its last show there, so the
// probe misses every pane the shell hides after the user has looked at it, which on the phone shell is the chat
// pane on every switch to another tab (the chat is the pane shown first). Firefox zeroes the hidden iframe's
// viewport instead and does not run its observer; the shim reads the union of the probe and the word, right in
// both. The panes that gate their paint (the feed and Outline panes, the timeline, and this fork's Waiting on you
// pane, waiting.ts) publish their gate's two measures as the word (paint-gate.ts publishPaneHidden, the one place
// the flag is named); the chat gates nothing, so this
// module publishes the same union from the same two events: the tab's visibilitychange and an IntersectionObserver
// over the page's body, which reports a display:none iframe as not intersecting and fires again on the way back.
// No timer, and nothing from the shell: each frame measures its own visibility. Until the observer has spoken
// nothing is published and the shim's probe decides; without an observer the probe stands for good. Injectable so
// node --test runs it; the browser leg (tests/test_pane_hidden_word_browser.py) runs the real thing.
