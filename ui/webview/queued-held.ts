// A kernel queued copy that LEFT the queue frame before its landed record arrived (T262i, the user 2026-09-08):
// the CLI takes a copy off the queue (a romp mail card, a nudge, a follow-up — the T243 gray card in the tail
// group) and later writes its record, and the two facts reach the pane in different pushes — the kernel's queue
// state first, the transcript read later. Between them the tail is SHORTER by the card, the browser clamps a
// reader within that height of the bottom, and the landed card then grows the tail back below them: a card above
// the bottom, follow mode off, the jump chip shown. So a vanished copy is HELD in place, marked landing, until the
// atom that carries its identity arrives (T252c: the queued copy's `qid` is the landed atom's `qid`, or one of its
// `qids`), and the atom then takes the copy's slot in the same frame. A copy with no id (an older kernel
// route, a copy the backend queued itself) is held by TEXT for the one push it vanished on, and dropped at the
// next push that carries the queue if nothing claimed it — never a phantom. A held identified copy is dropped the
// moment a LATER landing shows the CLI has passed it (the queue is first-in-first-out: had the copy landed, its
// record would precede that one), or when the kernel lists it queued again (it came back; nothing to hold).
// Pure and DOM-free so node --test executes it; render.ts owns the per-session memory and the splice.
