// T237 (the user 2026-09-03, twice, ~4:25 PM PT): the marked passage must not turn YELLOW until the reply
// has LANDED. Two sightings, one design: the mark wears a faded AWAIT-GREEN `.busy` wash while the thread
// is mid-reply and settles into the yellow `.unread` the moment the reply lands — and both times the green
// failed to apply. Convicted at the source:
//   * `.busy` keyed on a CLIENT gesture latch (cmtAwaitBase) that any session's comments frame could prune
//     (the prune ran against ONE session's thread list) and that cleared on a reply-arrived heuristic
//     (agentCount rising + !threadBusy(state)) — the first agent record of a multi-record turn with the
//     backend's state read as ""/waiting dropped the wash while the thread was still responding; the
//     msgs-derived replyOwed() fallback flips false at that same first record.
//   * `unread` keyed in the kernel on ANY agent record newer than the watermark — an intermediate text
//     block or tool call of a turn in progress painted yellow before the turn ended.
// Fix: the kernel is the one truth (tests/test_comment_threads.py pins the rule): `replyOwed` (green) and
// `unread` = a FINISHED reply newer than the watermark (yellow), both from the thread's transcript with the
// event model's own turn-end. The client keys `.busy` on th.replyOwed and keeps the gesture latch only for
// the pre-round-trip instant (from the send click until a frame carries the send); no timers anywhere.
