// Instrumenting every programmatic scroll write of the chat transcript (T262, the user 2026-09-08: the view
// "jumps up slightly on my scroll in many, many sessions", on a page whose bundle state is unknown). A recording
// alone cannot say WHICH writer moved the view; the laptop's client-diag journal can, once every write to
// #content.scrollTop rides one helper that files a breadcrumb — {surface:"chat", what:"scrollwrite",
// data:{sid, writer, before, after, delta, stick, gesture:false}} — and every scroll the writes do not explain
// files a "scrollgesture" marker, so the recording's timestamps line up against the journal.
//
// Cheap by construction: no stack traces, one row per write that actually moved the view, a per-session
// per-minute cap for each row kind (a following tail writes the bottom on every append; a wheel scroll fires
// dozens of gesture events a second), with one "capped" row at the cap so a silence in the journal is never
// mistaken for a quiet pane. The minute is the wall clock's minute bucket — a bound on volume, not a timer
// that decides behaviour. Pure and DOM-free so node --test executes it.
