// kernel resolves the directory, spawns tmux or connects the SDK, and the first transcript poll comes
// back — seconds, sometimes many. Nothing could be typed in that gap, and the only thing on screen was a
// dialog with three dots. So the tab appears at once in the OPENING state with a live composer; anything
// typed is held and flushed the moment the real session lands, and a create that FAILS says so in a
// dialog instead of the cue quietly timing out after thirty seconds.
//
// The provisional id must NOT contain a colon. Federation routes on `id`/`sid` and reads the part before
// a colon as a HOST, so a "pending:" form would send every op on this tab to a machine named "pending" —
// the same trap that swallowed follow-ups on remote cards. A dash keeps it unroutable and obviously not
// a uuid.
