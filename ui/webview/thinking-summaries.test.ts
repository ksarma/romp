// Thinking summaries (2026-09-01), pinned at the source like the other webview tests (the chat
// renderer has no jsdom harness):
//  - the FEED rule: a thinking block is opaque ("Thinking…") only when it has a signature AND no
//    text. The old `ev.encrypted ? "Thinking…" : ev.text` hid every summary once the kernel asked
//    the API for them, because a summarized block carries both a signature and its text. The
//    kernel computes the flag the same way; the renderer re-checks the text so a bundle talking to
//    an older kernel (flag = signature only) still shows any text it is handed.
//  - the GEAR toggle: a per-install kernel-side checkbox beside the other kernel toggles, stamped
//    with its gesture time like every kernel-side setting the gear posts, filled from /version, named
//    in the stale-gesture toast — and deliberately NOT in federation's KERNEL_SETTING set, so it
//    never queues for or reaches another machine's kernel.
