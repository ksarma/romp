// A tab's width must not change with its state (T262g, the user 2026-09-08: the chat view slid up and down by one
// tab row at times). renderTabs appended the working dot (.tab-dot, 7 px plus the 4 px gap) only while a session was
// working or awaiting, so a tab grew and shrank with its state; with the strip filled to a wrap boundary, a dot
// appearing or vanishing added or removed a ROW, and every row change moves #content's box under the reader: a
// bottom reader's text slides by the row height (Chrome keeps the scroller at its maximum; on a wrap the pane's
// box-resize compensation writes the same). Measured in a lab: wrap -31 px / un-wrap +31 px per flip, no browser
// fault. Fix: every tab carries the dot's slot in every state — laid out, hidden when the state has no dot — so the
// strip's row count changes only when tabs are added, removed or renamed. The compacting bar keeps its own wider
// slot (a rare, deliberate state). Pure rule executed here; render.ts and the CSS pinned.
// The dot also explains itself on hover (tabDotTitle, the rule beside tabDotClass in tab-state.ts), in the feed's
// words: executed here against feed.ts's own phrases, and the render wiring pinned.
