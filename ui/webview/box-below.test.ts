// A box BELOW the transcript growing must not drop an at-bottom reader out of follow mode (T262e, the user
// 2026-09-08 11:30 AM PT: when the awaiting/background-task box appears between the transcript and the composer
// and covers part of the text, a reader at the bottom must stay at the bottom — the pane scrolls by the box's
// height — and today it does not). A box below the scroller changes the scroller's clientHeight and nothing else:
// the browser keeps scrollTop, fires no scroll event, and the reader who was at the bottom is now the box's
// height above it with the last lines covered; the next append reads atBottom false and leaves them there — the
// pane has fallen into scrolled-up mode by itself. The composer auto-grows the same way while a message is typed.
// Fix: a ResizeObserver on #bg-tasks and #footer with the rule OPPOSITE to the boxes-above compensation: a reader
// whose recorded follow mode is on (the view's `stick`, untouched by the growth since no scroll event fired) is
// written to the new bottom (writer "box-below"); a scrolled-up reader is untouched (their top line never moved).
// Pure rule executed here; render.ts wiring pinned. Also pinned: the browser's scroll anchoring stays ON for #content
// (a measured result, see the comment beside the rule in styles.css — the opt-out let the visible line drift
// 194-246 px after a window slide, where the anchoring held it at 0).
