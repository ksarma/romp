// While a picked/dropped/pasted file's bytes ship to the kernel (shipFileToHost →
// dropFile → droppedPath), the attachment strip shows a PENDING chip — name +
// pulsing dots — from the instant the file is chosen. On a phone that round trip
// is seconds long (base64 + a fragmented WS send + the kernel write), and with
// nothing on screen it read as a dead click (the user 2026-08-11: "seemed like it
// didn't work for a second and then the thumbnail appeared").
//
// Lifecycle is EVENT-based end to end: the chip goes up on pick, and comes down
// only on the ack (droppedPath), the kernel's loud nack (dropSaveFailed), a
// FileReader error, or the user's own ✕ — never a timer.
//
// The chat renderer has no jsdom harness, so — like the other webview tests —
// pin the wiring at the source level.
