// The "worked …" footer's rule, pure (2026-09-06): which reply carries the footer, and how long it says.
//
// A reply's footer depends on LATER events — the turn has to be complete (a genuine human prompt landed
// after it) or the session idle — which made it the one thing on a rendered turn that a later event could
// change without the kernel naming that turn in a chatTail. The chat's tail path re-renders exactly the
// events the kernel names as changed (render.ts syncViewInner), so the footer is patched by unit from this
// plan instead of a trailing window re-rendered on every tail.

 *  (a nudge or a postal push that prompted the work, not the older human prompt: the user 2026-06-22, who
 *  saw "worked 23m" on a two-minute-old nudge) — to the reply's own stamp. Injected user lines (a postal

/** The footer to reconcile after a tail re-rendered events [from, len): the one reply BEFORE `from` whose

 *  No earlier reply can change: before `from` it is followed either by a non-prompt event (never a footer,
 *  before or after the tail) or by a genuine prompt (its turn was already complete, and a complete turn's
 *  footer reads nothing past that prompt). The tail changes that one reply's footer in four ways: a prompt
 *  landing completes its turn (the footer goes on); the session going idle with an empty suffix (`from` =
 *  len) completes it too; a reply landing in the same turn demotes it (the footer comes off, the new reply
 *  having been rendered with its own); the session going back to work on the same turn — a nudge, say —
 *  takes it off again. Replies at or past `from` were just rendered with their footer and are not named. */
