// Chat rail rendering (the user 2026-06-13/14). Two changes, both about the left rail:
//   1. Tool outcome lives ONLY on the left dot now — green ✓ disc on success, red ✗ disc on
//      error. The duplicate right-side in-head ✓/✗ (`.tool-status`) was removed.
//   2. A day boundary shows its date on a full-width divider above the day's first turn, NOT in
//      the rail — the gutter is 47px and "Yesterday" measures 52.6px, so it used to be clipped.
// The chat renderer has no jsdom harness, so — like the feed-*.test.ts files — pin at the source.
