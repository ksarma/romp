// The reader's place across a rebuild that RE-WINDOWED the view (T262l, 2026-09-08, from a lab run). A settings
// change re-renders every view from scratch; the fresh tail window of a long transcript rarely holds the anchor turn
// of a reader scrolled up, so the direct restore (restoreScrollAnchor: query the uuid in the DOM, write its kept
// offset) found nothing, the land put the reader on the raw saved scrollTop in a layout whose spacer estimate had
// moved by thousands of pixels, and the anchor turn drifted about 200 px on screen (measured: -0.1 px → +198 px over
// two re-renders, spacer rows dTop -10348 / dBot +4378). When the direct restore misses, the deep-link land takes over
// with the kept offset: it renders a window AROUND the anchor's unit (or fetches older history and re-lands on
// arrival) and writes "keep-offset", the anchor's exact on-screen position. Measured after: -0.14 px → -0.14 px, no
// moves. render.ts wiring pinned (the machinery it reuses has its own executed tests).
