// The tab ✕ (End-session) click must not be dropped mid-press (the user 2026-06-30). renderTabs() does
// `#tabs`.replaceChildren() on EVERY kernel push, so a push that lands between mousedown and mouseup on a
// tab's ✕ destroys the pressed node — the native `click` then never fires (or retargets to the data-act-less
// #tabs), the `close` delegate never runs, and the "End session?" dialog never opens. Intermittent: frequent
// while the fleet is busy (many pushes), rare when idle. Delegation to the stable #tabs (which normally
// survives a rebuild) can't save a click whose pressed node is gone. Fix: HOLD renderTabs while a pointer is
// pressed on the strip and flush AFTER release — the timeline's proven _pointerHeld pattern. Source-pin (no
// jsdom for the SVG/tab-bar draw path, like the sibling render-*/tab-*.test.ts).
