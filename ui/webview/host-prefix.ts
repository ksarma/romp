// A federated (remote) session surfaces everywhere as "host:name" — federation.js prefixes BOTH the
// display name and the sid with "host:" as messages arrive, and a LOCAL sid is a bare uuid that never
// contains a colon. So the sid is the designed marker: when it carries a host prefix and the name
// starts with the same prefix, the "host:" part is METADATA, not part of the name — and it renders as
// such (quiet gray, never bold, italic, a step smaller) instead of wearing the session's identity
// color at full weight (the user 2026-07-11). One helper + one .host-prefix class for every surface.
/** The host a federation-prefixed id belongs to, or "" (local) for a bare id. Session ids are UUIDs
 *  (no colon), so a colon unambiguously marks the host prefix. Lives HERE — the side-effect-free
 *  helper module — because importing federation.ts BOOTS a FederationManager (its module tail
 *  bootstraps one on load, by design: it is its own script, loaded once per page). preview.ts
 *  importing it for these two helpers bundled a SECOND manager into the feed/chat pages, and the
 *  twin — hearing only the remote sockets, never the shim's local frames — emitted remote-only merged
 *  feeds in alternation with the real manager's complete ones: every LOCAL card blinked out and
 *  right back, remote cards persisting (the user 2026-07-31, screen recording). Import federation.ts
 *  from nothing; federation-single-instance.test.ts enforces it. */
