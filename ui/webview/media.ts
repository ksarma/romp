// fetches fail silently and the features quietly vanish (the empty model
// picker, the user 2026-07-13). The kernel gates every request on the serve
// token, loopback included: the browser rides its sign-in (the session cookie,
// and the page key the fetch wrapper adds), but a webview's cross-origin fetch
// carries neither, so
// the host also injects window.__rompKernelToken and it rides here as ?token=.
