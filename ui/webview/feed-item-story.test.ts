// The per-item STORY (the user 2026-07-20: a giant card's stale subs, where they couldn't tell if the subs were still
// active): a non-done sub-goal shows a one-line gist of its newest verdict event in OUTCOME words
// ("asked you · 2h ago"), expandable (keyed state, survives re-renders) to the full block/unblock log,
// each row a jump to its own chat turn. The data was always in the goal store's node log — the kernel
// now ships it compacted (_node_log_rows) and the feed renders it. Progressive disclosure: gist →
// history → transcript, each one click. No jsdom for the feed renderer, so pin at the source.
