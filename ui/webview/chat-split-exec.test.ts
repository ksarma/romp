// The page's half of the chat columns, RUN (the chat split, 2026-09-11; a review find: the partition's page-side rules had
// source-shape pins only). The functions render.ts wires into renderTabs, the focus gates and the create flow are lifted
// with esbuild (the skeleton-tabs-wiring.test.ts chipWorld pattern) over a fake parent window that plays the shell —
// __rompChatSets / __rompChatTarget / __rompClaimSession and a counting postMessage — and driven the way renderTabs and
// the message handler drive them: the emptiness post (once per emptiness, reset by a member listed again; never before
// the first strip, never for the first column, never over a create in flight, never for a member whose host has not
// reported on this socket — the host-prefixed tab whose new column folded under it, 2026-09-14), the stale-active fallback (the partition's
// only: a page with no sets boots as before; the first visible member after the timer; a wanted tab held elsewhere
// retired; re-checked at fire time), the hop to the owner (once, into the owner's frame, never this frame), the claim of a
// created session, the offer of orphaned state, and the adoption of a moved tab's state onto every slice. The pure
// partition (columnHolds), the id shapes and the staged stack are the real modules. Synthetic ids only.

// ── the strip's arrival, RUN: applyTabOrder itself, with the frames a column receives ─────────────────────────────
// The vanishing tab (the user 2026-09-12): a tab dragged into a new column vanished from every column and came back
// about fifteen seconds later behind a "Couldn't close" toast. The chain was client-side: the new column's federation
// manager re-emitted the merged order from an EMPTY store (a view-order storage event from another pane landing between
// the bundle's frame-handler registration and the kernel's first strip), applyTabOrder took that synthetic frame as
// the board, and noteColumnEmptiness posted colEmpty for a member the kernel never stopped listing. The world below
// lifts the real applyTabOrder, ackClosingTabs, noteColumnEmptiness and stripLists, with the strip pass renderTabs
// runs before the post (order, then pushed tabs not yet in it, each through stripLists; chat-split.test.ts pins the
// real lines) and stubs for the teardown, the restore and the body. The no-base re-ask is recorded (HOOKS.asked), so the
// arm's re-emission gate runs here too (the cold-boot lab, 2026-09-16; tab-ghost-heal.test.ts pins its shape).
