 *  - a session on ANOTHER kernel: the frame carries none of that kernel's labels. The viewer's label
 *    for it need not be its own hostname, and its labels for the viewer's kernel or a third host are
 *    unknowable here. Every name goes in bare: the recipient's own siblings resolve as locals there,
 *    and a name that is ambiguous there is refused by postal with the candidates listed as host:name,
 *    which the agent can pick from (docs/guide.md says so).
