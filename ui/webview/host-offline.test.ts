// A DISCONNECTED remote's sessions must SAY so (the user 2026-07-29, who read a remote host's
// transcripts for a while before realising nothing was connected). Its tabs, lanes and cards stay —
// dropping them would lose the thread — but the "host:" token is struck and the tab dims.
//
// It must say so WITHOUT taking the screen to do it (the user 2026-07-29, again): the first version put
// a banner across the top of the pane, which landed on the session tab strip and hid the sessions. The
// drop now flashes the rail's network glyph red three times — an event's cue for an event — and the
// steady state stays on the tab and the glyph's own colour. hostIsDown/hostDownNote are executed here
// against a stub manager; the per-surface wiring is pinned at source.
