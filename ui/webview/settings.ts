  subgoals: boolean;      // feed CARDS: show the inline sub-goal checklist (the user 2026-06-17); toggled from the feed FOOTER (the user 2026-06-18); the MODAL is unaffected
  // The timeline's judging band, split into its two judge SETS (the user 2026-06-29): index = the captioner +

  // Replaces the old single `debug` toggle (kept optional below for migration). Both OFF by default.
  showIndexJudges: boolean;
  showTriageJudges: boolean;
  debug?: boolean;    // LEGACY (the user 2026-06-17): the old single judging-band toggle; read as the migration fallback for the two judge-set toggles when those are unset. The ↻ restart button is always-visible (decoupled).
  backend: "sdk" | "codex";   // which backend a NEWLY-created session uses (the user 2026-06-22): "sdk" (Claude Code through the Agent SDK), "codex" (OpenAI Codex, docs/codex.md); a stored value of the retired terminal backend reads as sdk (loadSettings). Both coexist; this is only the default for the + button. Read at createSession time (render.ts). Default sdk (the user 2026-07-13).
  defaultDir: string;        // default working directory PREFILLED in the new-session field (the user 2026-06-22). A session starts there; the tab menu's "Move to folder…" can change it later. Empty → the kernel's serve dir. ~ / $VAR expanded server-side.
  showBranch: boolean;       // the MIRROR of the status line's branch widget (T409; the key the toggle used from 2026-06-23 to 2026-09-13): written from statusWidgets on every load and save, read by no one (a pre-widgets store's value was the gear's injected default: the one-shot migration discards it); the widget defaults on (the user 2026-09-13).
  showSessionBadge: boolean; // chat bottom-bar: a small badge with the session's NAME on its identity colour before Awaiting / Ready / Working (session-badge.ts). OFF by default (the maintainers via the user, 2026-09-10: the composer's placeholder already names the session; the badge is an opt-in second reading of it where the state shows).
  tabCtx: TabCtxMode;        // chat tabs: WHEN the context gauge shows beside each session name (the user 2026-08-08) — "over50" (default: only once half full, so quiet tabs stay clean), "always", or "never".
  stripGroupRows: boolean;   // chat tabs, grouped by tag: start EVERY tag group on its own row (upstream's T264 default, its row breaks in render.ts). OFF by default on the fork (the user 2026-09-08, whose strip of eleven tag groups became eleven rows): off, the groups follow one another inline and wrap as they need, the untagged trail behind its divider. Per device, like every setting here. Read by renderTabs and part of the strip's rebuild signature, so a gear flip repaints at once.
  showFilesControl: boolean;   // the Files control (the dashboard bar's toggle, the phone's tab) shows when on; off, the default since T317b (the user 2026-09-10), hides it and closes the pane (T317). A FRESH key: the T317-era gear merged its default `filesControl: true` into the object and saved it whole on any change, so that key cannot tell a chosen on from a merged-in one; it is never read and is dropped on the next save
  chatScheme: ChatScheme;    // chat TEXT scheme (the user 2026-08-24): raises body-text contrast without collapsing the tool-dimmer-than-prose hierarchy. A scheme = a text-tier variable set (styles.css body.scheme-*); "default" applies nothing — today's values exactly.
  chatTabTheme: ChatTabTheme;   // LEGACY, derived (2026-08-28): the chat TAB STRIP's appearance (T113). Now computed from `theme` on every load/save ("classic" -> classic strip, anything else -> the yatharth strip) so older panes/extension builds keep working; never set it directly.
  changesInline: boolean;   // the file viewer's Comments panel: mark a session's pending changes IN the text (insertions tinted, deletions struck), both views (the inline-display follow-on to plans/file-review.md, 2026-09-07). Toggled from the panel's header ("Show changes inline"), like `subgoals` from the feed footer — the gear MODAL does not show it. ON by default; off, the file reads as it is and every change is its card alone. Read by file-comments.ts at paint time; a flip elsewhere reaches an open panel through onExternalSettingsChange.
  commentsFilter: CommentsFilter;   // the same panel's filter (the filter follow-on, 2026-09-07): which cards the list shows and which marks the text wears — "all" (default), "comments" (comment cards of every kind; no change marks), or "changes" (change cards, each counting the comments about it; no comment highlights or region rectangles). Chosen from the panel's header (All · Comments · Changes), kept here like changesInline, which still applies on top of it; the gear MODAL does not show it. Read by file-comments.ts when a panel opens; a pick elsewhere reaches an open panel through onExternalSettingsChange.
  theme: Theme;   // the OVERALL dashboard theme (the user 2026-08-27, promoting the tab-strip setting): "classic" = the pre-720 dark look; "yatharth" = dark + the contributed strip aesthetic (what chatTabTheme:"yatharth" was); "yatharth-light" = the warm light theme (body.theme-light + the yatharth strip). Migration: a store written before `theme` existed seeds it from chatTabTheme.
  panes: PaneSet;   // which OPTIONAL dashboard panes this browser shows at all (the user 2026-09-10): Sessions (key timeline), Outline (key fleet) and Feed. Per browser, like the rail's romp-panes toggle, but a different thing: the rail hides a loaded pane; a pane off HERE is not in the dashboard at all (no rail button, no phone tab, no palette command, its iframe never given a src, so no socket and nothing built for it). The chat is required and not listed; the Files pane keeps its rail toggle. The shell (_LANDING_COLLAPSE_JS) reads it at boot and on the storage event; the kernel keeps judging and tracking regardless, this is a view setting.
  denseChrome: boolean;   // chat page: COMPACT TABS AND AGENTS (the user 2026-09-08: on a phone, the tab strip and the background-work panel left about three lines of transcript in view). Density only, as a body class (dense-chrome.ts applyDenseChrome, run with the scheme and theme appliers): smaller tabs and group headers in the strip, tighter rows in the #bg-tasks panel with its list capped at about four rows. OFF by default: the strip and the panel are unchanged until the gear opts in. Distinct from `compact`, the transcript's own tidy-up (tool runs collapsed, thinking hidden).
  tabWidgets: TabWidgetPrefs;   // the tab-title WIDGETS (T379, the user 2026-09-12): which of the registered marks a tab carries (the status dot, the context bar, the hot-key keycap), their order and their options, set from the gear's Tab widgets section on the Chat tab. `tabCtx` above stays the context bar's MIRROR: a store with no tabWidgets derives them from it, and every save writes it back from them (tab-widgets.ts).
  statusWidgets: StatusWidgetPrefs;   // the status line's WIDGETS (T409, the user 2026-09-13): which of the registered items the line above the composer carries (the folder and the branch by default, the session name and the host on request), in what order, with which options. showBranch and showSessionBadge above are its MIRRORS: written back on every save, never read (a store without this key reads the widget defaults: the one-shot migration).
  tabsLocked: boolean;   // chat tab strip: THE LOCK (T395, the user 2026-09-12): on, no tab moves (the drag reorder, a drag into another column or the split's edge, the tab menu's Move to rows) until the lock is clicked again. Per browser like every gear setting and fanned out the same way (settingsSync). OFF by default; only the literal true locks.
  perfShare: boolean;   // the browser's timing rows carry the page-load, resource, environment, visibility, byte and frame-gap fields (perf-telemetry.ts, the beacon extension; the user 2026-09-18, who wanted the phone's timing shared only by choice). Per browser; OFF by default, only the literal true turns it on; read raw from the store by the collector in every pane and the shell, never through this module.
  perfMute: boolean;    // the kill switch beside it: on, this browser posts no timing or connection row at all (the collector's minute and slowframe rows, the pane shim's return, close and stale rows, the shell's rows). OFF by default; only the literal true turns it on; read raw by the collector, the shim and the shell script.
  figureHosts: string[];   // the file viewer's figures from the web (plans/markdown-viewer.md decision 8, ruling 2026-09-07): the hosts whose pictures and clips a viewed file loads when it opens. A figure on any other host shows a placeholder naming the host, which loads it on one click; a host loaded that way stays loaded for the page (figure-gate.ts, per document, not stored here). Default FIGURE_HOSTS_DEFAULT: github.com and its image hosts, localhost and 127.0.0.1; the kernel's own origin is always allowed and needs no entry. Edited in the gear as one host per line, each read down to its host name (figureHostName); read by file-view.ts at every paint of a rendered markdown file, and a change reaches an open file through onExternalSettingsChange: a host added restores its placeholders in place, a host removed applies at the file's next paint (figure-gate.ts regateFigures).
