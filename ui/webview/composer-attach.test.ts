// The composer 📎 attach button opens a file picker on the machine whose SCREEN
// the user is looking at, routed by host the same way openPath/Browse… split:
//
//   • VS Code webview → the host extension's native open dialog (type:"pickFile");
//     the editor IS the local machine, so the dialog is on the right screen and
//     the picked path comes back as droppedPath.
//   • Web dashboard (http/https, any pointer) → the BROWSER's own picker (a
//     hidden <input type=file>) and the bytes ship via shipFileToHost → dropFile.
//     The old behavior posted pickFile to the kernel, whose native dialog opens
//     on the KERNEL's machine — the wrong screen entirely from a remote browser,
//     and on a headless kernel nothing but a warning (the user 2026-08-09).
//   • TOUCH keeps the phone photo-picker UX (accept=image/*, the user 2026-06-17);
//     a desktop browser gets an unscoped multi-select picker — attributes set per
//     open, when the pointer type is known.
//
// The chat renderer has no jsdom harness, so — like the other webview tests —
// pin the wiring at the source level.
