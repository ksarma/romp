// T262 (the user 2026-09-08, "jumped up slightly on my scroll in many, many sessions"): appendActive pinned a
// reader within the then 80 px follow threshold to the bottom on EVERY frame — a status-only chatTail included — so
// wheeling up from the tail of a working session snapped back within the first 80 px, over and over. The
// two-kernel harness reproduced it: a stop 60 px above the bottom moved 60 px to the bottom in a quiet window
// with scrollHeight unchanged (compact mode), and both modes snapped on the next frame. Rule: follow the tail
// only when there is something new to follow — the content's height changed — or when already at the very
// bottom (a no-op pin). Executed decision + render.ts wiring pins, red on the previous render.ts.
