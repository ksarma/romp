// TAB GROUPS ARE TAGS (the user 2026-09-04). The chat tab strip renders one section per tag, in the
// user's tag order, each tab under its HOME tag — the FIRST holder tag in tagOrder, the rule
// revealIn already states ("a tagged session's home is its first holder tag"), so a tab's section
// and its reveal agree. Sessions in no tag trail in an unlabeled section. No new store and no new
// session field: the kernel's views blob (tags, members, tagOrder) is the whole model, the headers
// are the very tags the Tags flyout edits, and reordering the groups IS reordering tagOrder — the
// kernel-persisted union order the timeline's tag-pill drag writes too, so the two surfaces cannot
// disagree. A session may hold other tags as well; they filter, they do not section.
//
// Per-browser state, this viewer's like romp:vieworder: whether the strip sections at all (ON by
// default whenever some tag holds a visible tab; the chat tag-lens menu's "Group tabs by tag" turns
// it off), which sections are folded, and which members show through their section's fold (the
// tab menu's "Show when folded"). `archived` starts folded — that tag exists to put sessions away.
// Notification is view-order.ts's two-path idiom: localStorage reaches other panes (the storage
// event), a same-window CustomEvent reaches the writer. Pure and DOM-free (the tab-order.ts
// pattern) so the rule executes in node tests; render.ts paints it.

 *  entry for every tag ever deleted, session ever closed, or member moved out. NOT judged — a sid whose
 *  host is detached, down, or attached and up with its tab list still on its way to this pane — it
 *  stands untouched: the host's sessions left the strip with the host (a detach dismisses every one; a
 *  page loaded during an outage never had them) or have not reached it yet, and its tags left the blob
 *  or stand cached, none of which is a session's end. The entries wait for the host's tabs, and the
 *  next pin write after that judges them for real
 *  (round 5 of the 2026-09-06 review: a pin click while a host was detached dropped every pin on its
 *  sessions, and they folded away on the reattach with no gesture on them; round 6: the same click in
 *  the seconds between a host's attach or a page load and its tab list's arrival did the same).
 *  On the WRITE path only (the pin row's click): a prune there moves nothing on screen, where a prune
 *  per render could act on a transient frame (a views blob mid-write, a reattached host's tags one
 *  supervisor pass behind its tabs) and put a tab away with no gesture. Returns `st` itself when
 *  nothing is dropped.
 *
 *  THE LIMITS: a LOCAL tab pinned under a section that only a remote host's tag made (the host tagged
 *  one of ours) is judged on that host's detach — the sid is local, and the entry names the section by
 *  name alone, a remote tag's id and so its host never being stored — and dropped, since no union of
 *  the name holds it; the user sets the pin again after the reattach. And a reattached host's tabs and
 *  tags reach this pane by two roads: the tabs over the relay, within a /tunnels poll (4 s) of the row
 *  coming up and the socket's connect; the tags on the LOCAL kernel's views blob, which the tunnel
 *  supervisor's pass that marks the host up reads and caches, and which the pusher ships on its next
 *  tabOrder frame — the kernel wakes the pusher when a host's cached read changes
 *  (`_cache_remote_views`), so that is the next cycle: sub-second on an idle box, the end of the cycle
 *  in flight on a loaded one (20-40 s). So the tabs can lead the tags by up to a pusher cycle, and by
 *  a supervisor pass (15 s) more when the kernel's first read of the host's /views fails while its
 *  /sessions probe answers: a pin write in that window sees the host's sessions as known tabs that no

 *  redialed, a stale base coalescing several frames) computes the rename the first pane followed and,
 *  following it again, would undo what the user did in between — a pin turned off after the split —
 *  or split a pin made after the rename; the rename was the event, and it was acted on (round 5 of the
 *  2026-09-06 review). The memory is the RENAME's, not a frame's: a remote host's rename rides the
 *  local blob (remoteTags, the kernel's cached read of the host) with no change to the blob's write
 *  seq, so no seq could name it; and a tag renamed back and then forth again is followed each time,
 *  each being to a name the memory does not hold for it. Every rename the frame carries is remembered,
 *  matched or not, and the memory is checked against EVERY adopted blob, renames or none (adoptBase
 *  runs this on each), and kept to what the blob confirms — PER HOST: an entry stands while the blob
 *  names its tag by the remembered name (the late pane's case: the tag is where its pins were carried),
 *  or while it is a remote host's (`host:tid`) and the blob carries none of that host's tags — a
 *  detach pops the host's cached read (a DOWN host's stays), and a reattach's tabs can run ahead of it
 *  (prunePinned's limits) — since the blob cannot say whether the tag is gone or the host is, and a
 *  rename followed in that window would otherwise erase the memory of the host's renames, for a stale
 *  pane to re-apply one after the reattach (round 6 of the 2026-09-06 review). A deleted tag's entry
 *  goes: a local id the store lacks, or a remote id its host lists without. And a tag the blob names by
 *  ANOTHER name was renamed on while no client watched (the page closed; the host detached; a pane's
 *  socket dead across two renames), and its entry is a rename this browser OWES: the memory says where
 *  the tag's pins were left, the blob where the tag is now, so the pins under the remembered name are
 *  carried to the blob's name in this adoption, as a watched rename's are — the tag's own members
 *  deciding (`locals` / `remotes` on the union: the merge would reach a same-named tag's tabs) — and the
 *  memory is re-stamped. Kept as it was, the memory read the tag's next rename to the remembered name
 *  as already followed: a remote tag renamed web → api (followed), back to web while its host was
 *  detached, and to api again after the user pinned the tab under web kept the pin under web, and the
 *  tab folded away with no gesture on it (round 7). Dropped without the carry, it left the pin where
 *  the late pane could not find it: a pane whose held blob predated two renames (web → api, watched by
 *  another pane, which carried the pin to api; then api → ops) computed the coalesced web → ops,
 *  matched nothing under web, and stamped ops — and the watching pane's api → ops then read as already
 *  followed, the pin still under api and the tab folded away (round 8). The frame's own renames
 *  re-stamp the memory after the check (a rename the frame itself carries from the remembered name is
 *  followed once), so a watched rename away from the remembered name is remembered under its new one.
 *  Returns `st` itself when every rename is already followed, or stood down, and the memory stands —
 *  the late pane writes nothing and notifies no one; a stale entry's drop alone is a write, pins
 *  untouched.
 *
 *  THE EVIDENCE ORDER (round 9): each memory entry is stamped with the write seq of its tag's STORE as
 *  the adopted blob carried it (`followedSeq`) — the blob's own `seq` for a local tag; for a remote
 *  host's tag the host's own, which the kernel carries on each remoteTag row (a remote rename rides the
 *  local blob with no change to the local seq, so the host's is the seq that orders it) — and a blob
 *  whose seq for that store is OLDER than the stamp stands down on the tag: the entry is kept as it is,
 *  the blob's other name for the tag is not a rename owed, a rename the frame itself carries for the tag
 *  is not followed, and nothing is re-stamped, because the memory was written from newer evidence than
 *  the blob is (the writer whose evidence predates the diary stands down). At the stamp's seq or past
 *  it the blob proceeds. Before this, a pane adopting an intermediate frame late — held V0 (web),
 *  adopting V1 (api) after another pane had carried the pin on V2 (ops) — read ops against api as the
 *  rename it owed, carried the pin to api, and its own V2 frame carried it back: a flap on no new
 *  information; with the stamp, its V1 is older than the memory and moves nothing. `views` is the
 *  adopted blob, for the local seq; a seq the blob does not carry (no `views`; a kernel or host from
 *  before the stamp) orders nothing — such a tag is never stood down, its stamp is not stored, and the
 *  check runs as it did. The re-adoption of the very blob a pane holds is a different case, and
 *  followAdoption's name check answers it before this runs, seq or none.
 *
 *  THE LIMITS: a remote-only pin has no id, so a rename of the remote tag that happens while no client
 *  of this browser is watching (the page closed, the blob's first frame after it) is followed only
 *  through the memory — this browser having followed an earlier rename of the tag, which ties the
 *  pin's name to the tag's id. With no memory of the tag, the entry stays under the old name, where it
 *  matches nothing until the user pins the tab again; the pin set again follows the tag's next rename,
 *  and from then on its unwatched ones too. A local tag's pin carries the id and has no such gap. A
 *  memory entry without a stamp — written before the stamp, or from a blob that carried no seq — stands
 *  no blob down, so the late-intermediate flap above remains possible for that tag until a followed
 *  rename stamps it. A store restored to an OLDER copy (a kernel restarted over a restored views
 *  file serves it under the old seq) is stood down for its tags until its next write, whose seq —
 *  time-ordered on every kernel — passes the stamp. And two name states can share ONE seq on one path:
 *  the timeline's Obsidian (Electron) branch writes the views file itself under the seq it holds, and the
 *  kernel's reader leaves an equal seq alone, so two renames made there in a row reach every client under
 *  one seq (the kernel's own tag door bumps the seq on every write, so no other surface does this). A pane
 *  processing the first of them late, after another pane has followed the second, is not stood down —
 *  the seq is at the stamp, not below it — and moves the pin once, its own next frame carrying it back:
 *  one round, a remote-only pin folded away between that pane's two adoptions. */

 *  returns `st` itself, UNLESS it is newer than the memory's evidence for a tag it names otherwise
 *  (newerThanMemory), when the check runs on it. Every other blob runs the frame's renames and the
 *  memory check, under the stores' seqs (followTagRenames). `unions` are `next`'s, passed when the
 *  caller has them.
 *
 *  THE SHORTCUT (round 9 of the 2026-09-06 review): the memory was checked against those very names when
 *  the held blob was adopted, and what has changed since is the memory, by another pane's hand, from a
 *  blob this pane has not seen. Such a blob is the held one re-emitted — the federation router re-emits
 *  its stored blob on a view-order storage event from any pane, a remote host's push, a `closed` frame or
 *  a host drop, and a pane whose local socket is dead (a background tab's throttled redial, a half-open
 *  socket) re-adopts it each time, an equal seq being admitted — or a frame that changed something else.
 *  Run on it, the check read the fresher pane's stamp (memory api, blob web) as the rename this browser
 *  owed IN REVERSE, carried the pin back over that pane's follow and re-stamped; the fresher pane's next
 *  adoption carried it forward again: the pin moved twice per trigger on no new information, for as long
 *  as the stale pane stayed stale.
 *
 *  ITS EXCEPTION (round 10): a blob naming every tag as the held one does can still be NEWER than the
 *  memory. Two panes hold api for a remote tag; one's socket dies; the host renames api → ops and the
 *  other pane carries the pin (memory ops, stamped at the host's seq), then closes; the host renames
 *  ops → api; the first pane redials and adopts that blob. The names are the held ones and the blob is
 *  real news: its seq for the host's store is past the stamp, and the memory names the tag otherwise —
 *  the rename this browser owes, ops → api, which the shortcut alone left uncarried: a remote-only pin
 *  stayed under ops, where nothing matched it, and the tab folded away until the tag's next rename (or
 *  for good, once a pin write judged the orphan). So the shortcut yields when a STAMPED memory entry
 *  disagrees with the blob's name for its tag AND the blob's seq for that store is strictly past the
 *  stamp; the check then runs, and the seqs order it. An unstamped entry keeps the shortcut — no blob is
 *  known newer than it, and a stale pane's re-emitted blob from a host that stamps no seq would otherwise
 *  carry the pin back, the round-9 flap — and so does a blob at or below the stamp, which the check would
 *  stand down on that tag regardless (rule (b), followTagRenames). */
