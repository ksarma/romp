// The file VIEWER mounts in both documents (file-view.ts is one shared module), but the chat page
// loads styles.css alone and the feed page feed.css alone — so its dress is declared in BOTH sheets
// (the .romp-acted / filebrowse precedent). The copies had already drifted once (feed.css lacked the
// a.fileview-btn anchor rules, so the GitHub link rendered hrefless-underlined there, 2026-08-26).
// This pins the shared chrome byte-equal so it cannot drift again. Rules that are deliberately
// pane-specific (the md body, wrap mode, load cue) are not pinned.
