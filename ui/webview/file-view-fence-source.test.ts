// A fence's text as the note holds it, for the viewer's Copy button (fence-source.ts; Slice 3 of plans/markdown-viewer.md, the
// slice's review, round 1). marked 12's lexer turns every leading run of tabs into four spaces a tab before it tokenizes, so a
// code token's text, and the code element's textContent mdBlock copies from, carry spaces where the note has tabs: a Makefile
// recipe copied out of the rendered view pasted back with spaces. The module reads each token's lines back out of the note
// through the rewrite. Exercised over the REAL marked: the tokens come from marked.parse's walkTokens, the way mdBlock collects
// them, so the cases pin marked's own transformations (the expansion, a list item's indent slice, a quote's stripped `> `,
// indentCodeCompensation, CRLF) beside the module's reading of them. Synthetic notes throughout.
