// The chat's HISTORY REGIONS (T386 stage 2, plans/chat-history-regions.md Part B): a session's transcript is an ordered list of
// regions over its turns, RUNS the page holds (rendered, virtualised as before) and GAPS it does not (empty space of an estimated
// height with the loading glyph while a request is in flight). The TAIL run is always resident and always live, so no client is
// ever detached, and the kernel never withholds a delta. Pure: node executes every rule here (chat-regions.test.ts); render.ts
// wires them to the DOM.
//
// Spans are TURN indices, [lo, hi), as the kernel numbers them (its pages are PAGE_TURNS-aligned in that numbering). The tail run's
// `hi` is null: it ends wherever the transcript ends now, and grows with every chatTail.
