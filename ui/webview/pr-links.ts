// GitHub pull-request references in rendered text become links to the PR page of the repository the
// session works in (the user 2026-09-06, whose sessions' chat, feed cards and notes rendered their own
// PR numbers, `merged #12` say, as plain text). The kernel names the repository per session —
// `githubRepo` (owner/repo, or null) on the session frame and on the feed's session rows, derived from
// the session tree's origin remote by the same parser the file viewer's GitHub link uses — and this
// module does the text work in ONE place for every surface: the chat's markdown (render.ts md()), the
// feed's card titles, distiller lines, checklists, held-mail gists and modal (feed.ts), and the
// outline's goal rows (fleet.ts).
//
// Shapes that link — each needs a word boundary BEFORE it (start of text, whitespace, an opening
// bracket or quote, a comma/semicolon/colon, an em or en dash), so a `#` glued to letters, a path or a
// URL never does:
//   #123               → https://github.com/<session repo>/pull/123
//   PR #123 / pull #123 (any case, the space optional) → the same; the whole phrase is the link
//   owner/repo#123     → https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 — a reference into another repository
// GitHub answers /pull/<n> for an ISSUE number with a redirect to /issues/<n>, so one form covers both.
// The ASCII hyphen is deliberately NOT a boundary: it ends URL paths and identifiers
// (`https://example.com/a-#12` must stay plain); the dashes appear in neither.
//
// A slash-separated RUN of bare references (`#12/#13`, `PRs #12/#13/#14`) links each one — GitHub's own
// autolinker does (checked against its markdown renderer, 2026-09-06) — every reference in the run
// against the session's repository; `/` is still no boundary on its own, so a `/#13` links only as the
// continuation of a reference before it, never inside a URL, and a run that ends in a path (`#12/#13/x`)
// stays plain like `#12/x`. After a cross-repo reference a `/` refuses the whole (GitHub would read the
// `#13` in `owner/repo#12/#13` against the CONTEXT, a writer means owner/repo: two readings, no link).
//
// The cross-repo form follows GitHub's own name grammar. An owner (a user or organization login) is
// alphanumerics and single hyphens — never leading, trailing or doubled — at most 39 characters; a
// repository name may also carry `.` and `_`, at most 100 characters, and never ENDS in `.` (`.` and
// `..` are the path names, and GitHub serves no `owner/repo.` — a trailing dot is sentence punctuation
// glued to a `#`, as in `notes-api.#7`). So `my.org/repo#1` (a dotted owner), `a/..#12` and
// `owner/repo.#1` are not references. Two plain words around a slash
// (`src/lib#3`) ARE one — that is GitHub's syntax byte for byte, and a directory path never carries a
// bare numeric fragment (a line reference is `file.py#L12`, which fails the number shape) — so it
// links. The one refusal beyond the grammar is a "repo" that reads like a FILENAME (`docs/x.html#12`,
// `src/app.py#3` — an extension-shaped tail after a dot): that is a path with a fragment, and a wrong
// link is worse than none. The cost is a repository named like a file (`something.js`, `tool.dev`),
// which stays plain text in the cross-repo form — except GitHub Pages repos (any `*.github.io`, the one
// standard dotted repo name; a fork keeps the original's), which link. A session's OWN repo is never
// filtered this way: the
// kernel shipped it, so a bare `#12` links in a `user.github.io` or `something.js` checkout too.
//
// What never links: text inside code-like elements (<code>, <pre>, <kbd>, <samp>, <var>, <tt> — a
// color `#fff`, a CSS id, a shell comment, a quoted key or token), text already inside an <a> (a GitHub
// URL marked autolinked, a [text](url)), a path link (.file-uri-link), and any `#` that is part of a
// word, a URL fragment or a color literal — `#1EA1EB` and `#0c1a2e` fail the number shape (hex letters
// after the digits, or a leading zero; a PR number has neither). Typographic wrappers (<em>, <strong>,
// <sup>) are walked: a `#13` in them is still a reference.
// A session with no GitHub repository (`githubRepo` null: no repo, no origin, or an origin elsewhere)
// links NOTHING, the cross-repo form included — the honest rendering is the plain text, never a
// guessed host.

 *  files each peer under the name the local side knows it by — the ssh alias it was attached as when
 *  there is one, else the name the peer declared at check-in (postal_service.py `_canon_peer_name`) —
 *  and no host id crosses the wire for the dashboard to match on instead (its rows wear the aliases IT
 *  attached each host as; the bus id never reaches a frame). So the fold and the row match hold when
 *  the two kernels agree on the name, which the common topology gives: the dashboard's kernel declares
 *  its own name (`selfHost`) at check-in and the remote files it under that, unless it attached this
 *  machine under an alias of its own. When the names disagree the stamp matches no row and the
 *  reference stays text — the safe direction, pinned by the tests; a WRONG link needs the card's kernel

/** Follow a PR link the way the chat follows its links (render.ts's a[href] delegate): on the web

 *
 *  Click-safe across re-renders (ui/CLAUDE.md): the action hangs on the STABLE document, keyed off the

 *  primary button, `pointerup` on a pr-link with the SAME href opens it — the rebuilt twin counts, the
 *  node's identity does not — and the native click that may follow is spent, so the card's own handler
 *  never sees it. That click can land only on the released node or one of its ancestors (the anchor
 *  itself, or the common ancestor when the pressed node is gone), so only a click there is spent: one
 *  arriving anywhere else with no press behind it — the browser fired none, then a programmatic
 *  .click() or an assistive-technology activation came — passes as the ordinary click it is (the flag
 *  ate one such click before; review find, 2026-09-06). The click path itself stays for a keyboard
 *  activation (Enter on a focused link fires click alone). Every flag clears on the next press, key or
 *  click — an event, never a timer. The chat pane does NOT install this — its own delegate already opens
