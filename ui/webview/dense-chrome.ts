// COMPACT TABS AND AGENTS (the gear's denseChrome setting; the user 2026-09-08, whose phone showed
// about three lines of transcript between the tab strip and the box of background work). Density
// only: ONE body class, `dense-chrome`, that styles.css's scoped block keys on for the strip's tabs
// and group headers and the #bg-tasks box's rows. The chat calls this beside applyTheme from
// applyChatScheme (render.ts), at startup and on every settings change, so a gear flip repaints the
// strip and the box at once through the cascade, with no rebuild of either. Pure over the document
// it is handed, like theme.ts, so a test can run it against a fake body. Absent or off, the class is
// removed and the page renders exactly as before the setting existed.
