// Links inside a file the viewer shows (the user 2026-09-07): an http(s) URL in the text opens in a new tab, a
// file path opens in the viewer, and a Markdown link's target follows the same two rules. One pass over the TEXT
// NODES of a body the viewer has already built, never over its HTML string: hljs's markup and the sanitizer's
// verdicts stand, no raw file text is ever parsed as markup, and a row's text reads exactly as the file's after
// the pass (the comments panel's Raw index checks every row against the file character by character, anchor-map.ts
// rawIndex; a pass that changed one character would unmap every comment). The pass ADDS elements around runs of
// text and nothing else.
//
// The pass reads a LINE at a time, not a text node (path-links.ts textUnits, under LINE_UNITS: a code view's row, or
// a rendered block whose own line breaks are whitespace to the gate): the highlight wraps a shell or template
// substitution in a span of its own, so `"$HOME/docs/a.md"` reaches the DOM as three text nodes, and a walk over
// the third alone read `/docs/a.md` as an absolute path that was never written (the 2026-09-07 review, the round's
// one high finding). Over the line's joined text the token is `HOME/docs/a.md`, glued to the `$` before it, and the
// gate below refuses a token glued to anything but an opener. A token the highlight cut through (its text in two
// nodes) is left as it is, never re-read as its pieces, and so is a URL; a token inside a URL of its line is the
// URL's, wrapped or not (a cut URL stays text, and its query can carry a path). Text inside an inline SVG is read
// but never marked (path-links.ts DEAD_TEXT): an HTML element inserted into SVG text does not render.
//
// The path grammar is the chat's (path-links.ts: the one matcher, the one span, the one click act), run with the
// walk's options for a surface that is code rather than prose, plus one gate of its own, viewerPathGate. The chat
// has the kernel's stat verdict to narrow its matches; this surface has no verdict and narrows by shape, and every
// false link is noise on a surface the person reads for hours. The gate's grammar, in full (docs/guide.md says the
// same in the user's words): a token links when it has a slash and its last segment has a letter-led extension of
// one to eight letters or digits (a dotfile only under an anchored start: `/`, `./`, `../`, `~/`); it is not glued
// to the character before it (the line's start, whitespace or an opener must precede it: a quote, a bracket, `=`,
// `,`, `;`, `|`, or Markdown's `*` when the path is the whole emphasised text), which is what cuts `$HOME/docs/a.md`, `${dir}/out.json`, `$(ROOT)/src/x.c`,
// `@scope/pkg/index.js`, `C:/Users/x/file.txt` and `git@host:user/repo.git` down to prose; it is not inside a web
// address on its line; an unanchored token's first segment does not read as a hostname (`www.` or dotted labels
// ending in two or more letters: `www.example.org/docs/index.html`, `example.com/index.html`); an unanchored token is
// not the specifier an import statement or a require call names (`import x from "lodash/fp.js"`,
// `require("pkg/sub.js")`; the English `from` in `Copied from "docs/a.md"` names a file); and a `~` start is `~/`
// (`~user/x.md` names a home the kernel does not expand). A local
// file:// URI (an empty authority, or `localhost`) links as written. A relative token resolves against the shown
// file's own directory (a file's mentions are written from where the file is), an absolute or `~/` one passes to the
// kernel as written (it expands `~` and reads the file's session's machine), and the resolved path is normalized
// once, here (`docs/../src/app.py` opens, and is titled, listed and browsed, as `src/app.py`). A `:12` written after
// a path (or GitHub's `#L12`) rides in the link and the viewer scrolls to that line.
//
// What a click does is the viewer's (file-view.ts binds the body's delegate: the path act opens the file through
// the host's opener, a URL anchor opens itself, a modified click opens either in a tab of its own). This module
// marks; it binds no action.

 *  2026-09-07 review, round 3). An author's id or name reaches the DOM under the sanitizer's `user-content-` prefix
 *  (md-sanitize.ts, SANITIZE_NAMED_PROPS: GitHub's rule, so a note's `<p id="tabs">` can never answer to the page's
 *  own ids), so each arm reads that spelling and the bare one (the minted `md-` ids, and an author who typed the
 *  prefix), in document order: userContentTarget, the lookup the chat's `#` click reads too (md-sanitize.ts). Else
 *  the heading whose slug it is: marked gives headings no ids, and the viewer mints
 *  one per heading as `md-` + its GitHub slug (mdBlock), so `#Evidence Results`, `#evidence-results` and the
 *  percent-encoded spelling all name md-evidence-results. Mark time and click time both ask here (file-view.ts
 *  scrollToFragment). */

/** A rendered Markdown link's target, sorted the way the text is: a scheme (http:, https:, mailto:, …) or a
 *  protocol-relative `//host` opens a new tab, as the viewer always had it; a query alone (`?x=1`) is a web-style
 *  link to the page's own address and opens a new tab too (the viewer's document is never navigated); a fragment
 *  alone (`#section`) is the viewer's (FRAG_LINK_CLASS: the delegate scrolls to the element with that id, or the
 *  `<a name>` of that name, when the document holds one, else the title says there is none, since marked gives
 *  headings no ids); anything else names
 *  a file, relative to the shown one, and the anchor becomes a path link (the shared shape on its own <a>, so
 *  `[**bold** text](docs/x.md)` keeps its label). marked percent-encodes a destination (`my%20notes.md`), so it is
 *  decoded first; a `#L12` or `:12` on the target is the line; any other `#fragment` (`report.md#results`) rides
 *  as the section to land on once the file is open (data-frag); a `?query` is dropped from the path. The href comes
 *  off a path link: a browser must not follow it, and the chat's document-level opener reads
 *  only anchors with one. An anchor the sanitizer left without an href (a scheme it refuses, a file on another
 *  host) is dressed dead with the reason in its title, unless it is a named target and never was a link; so is a
 *  file target that resolves to no path (`[up](../)` from a file named without a directory). Every attribute is set
 *  as one (an inline SVG's <a> has no target, rel, className or title property to write). */
