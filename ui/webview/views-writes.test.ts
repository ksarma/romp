// THE CHAT PANE'S VIEWS WRITES ARE ACKNOWLEDGED (the user 2026-09-05, who lost a batch of tag
// renames and assignments). The tab menu's Tags flyout had the timeline dialog's shape: every
// gesture posted the WHOLE blob from the pane's own un-echoed optimistic copy, so a New tag… then a
// Move to carried the pre-burst `at` stamp and the kernel's stale-writer guard refused the second
// against the first; the copy cleared on an exact echo or after THREE frames, whichever came first.
// Now: tag gestures post TARGETED tagEdit ops; lens and order edits keep the whole-blob write; both
// carry a writeId the kernel's ack names, and the optimistic copy clears on the ACK — never on a
// frame count. Executed tests on the pure module (views-writes.ts) plus source pins on render.ts
// (the tab-order.ts pattern; no jsdom for render.ts). Synthetic ids only.
