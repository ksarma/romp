// An awaiting or compacting interval the session is STILL in arrives with its end at the payload's own
// clock (kernel _state_intervals ends an open span at `now`) AND an open mark as its third element
// ([start, end, true]): the renderer reads the mark (or a null end) as OPEN and draws the stripe to the
// live edge, the way barEndT draws an open work bar, so it glides with the edge instead of sitting at the
// kernel's build clock until the next rebuild (the lanes frame is projected from the cached build, so its
// clock can trail the live edge by up to a rebuild). The mark, not a clock compare (review find,
// 2026-09-08): the renderer used to read an end within 2 s of data.now as open, and a connect frame
// re-stamps the cycle clock over the cached build's lanes, so that distance was the cache's age and a lane
// blocked right now drew closed. The end stays numeric on the wire: a null end was a wire break for every
// already-loaded renderer (Math.min(null, t1) = 0 dropped the stripe). Headless draw() over a minimal DOM
// shim (the timeline-render.test.ts pattern), with the live edge pushed MAX_INTERP_AHEAD past data.now so
// "to the live edge" and "to the payload's end" land on different pixels.
