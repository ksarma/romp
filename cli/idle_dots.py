"""romp-idle-dots — the timer-side state doctor for romp sessions.

tmux @claude-state/@romp-emoji are written ONLY by the tmux-status.sh hook on
Claude events, so any state that should change while NO event fires needs a
timer. This watcher is that timer, sweeping live romp sessions every INTERVAL
for the two missing-timer cases:

1. IDLE FADE: a READY (waiting/idle) session fires no events, so its 🔵 dot
   would live forever — quiet > STALE_AFTER_SECS swaps it to ⚫, the tab-strip
   analog of how the dashboard and timeline fade an idle row (same threshold).

2. STUCK WORKING: Claude fires NO hook when a turn is interrupted with Esc, so
   an interrupted session sits at @claude-state=working forever — stranding the
   chat-tab chip, the timeline work-bar, AND the ghostty 🟡 dot at once (the
   2026-06-10 test_slector incident). A stale `since` ALONE can't tell an
   interrupted session from one legitimately inside a long tool call (neither
   fires events), so the PANE disambiguates: a genuinely-working Claude shows
   "(esc to interrupt)"; an interrupted one shows the idle composer (❯). Only
   working/compacting + stale since + idle-looking pane heals — mirroring the
   hook's Stop branch (state+since+emoji+states/<sid>.jsonl transition) so the
   chip, timeline, and dot all recover together. romp-chat-view's own Ctrl+C
   path resets state inline (markPaneIdle); this catches interrupts made in
   the terminal, where no software of ours is in the loop.

Healing is conservative: a pane in copy-mode (scrolled back) or with
unrecognizable content is left alone, and `since` is re-read just before
writing so a real hook event mid-sweep always wins.

Lifecycle: `--ensure` spawns a detached daemon
if one isn't already running, re-ensured from the status hook on idle AND on
prompt-submit (a turn can only get stuck after a prompt started it). The
daemon exits once no romp session remains.

Usage:
  romp-idle-dots            # daemon: loop until no romp sessions remain
  romp-idle-dots --once     # a single sweep (used by tests / manual checks)
  romp-idle-dots --ensure   # spawn the daemon if not already running
