# Install

## Requirements

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code), signed in.**
  Install it and run `claude` once in a terminal to log in.
- **Python 3.10 or newer, and Node.js.**

    ```bash
    brew install python node               # macOS (Homebrew)
    sudo apt install python3 nodejs npm    # Ubuntu / Debian
    ```

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romp-on/romp/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

Open a new terminal afterwards, so `~/romp/bin` is on your `PATH`, and type
`romp` to launch the user interface in a browser.

The same command updates Romp later. To remove Romp, run `romp uninstall` (add
`--purge` to delete recorded sessions too).

This clones Romp to `~/romp` and installs the newest release, mostly as
[symlinks back into that clone](architecture.md#what-the-installer-sets-up), so
updating the clone updates the installation with it. On a machine with several
Pythons, [which one runs the kernel](reference.md#the-kernels-python) matters.

### Manual and custom installs

Install this way to keep Romp somewhere other than `~/romp`, or to run the
latest commit rather than the newest release:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romp-on/romp.git ~/romp
cd ~/romp
git checkout "$(git tag -l 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | grep -E '^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' | head -n1)"   # newest release
# or:   git checkout main                                        # the latest commit
./install.sh
```

Then add `bin/` to your `PATH` in your shell rc; `install.sh` prints the exact
line for your clone.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/romp/bin"
```

## First run

The installer leaves Romp's back end running, so there is nothing to start. Open
the dashboard by typing `romp` in the terminal. That prints the URL at which
Romp can be reached and opens it in your browser.

### In VS Code or Cursor

The installer adds the extension automatically. Reload your editor window and
open Romp from the sidebar.

time.
