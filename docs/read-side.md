# The read side: the kernel, the UI, and the three panes

!!! note "Optional reading"
    You don't need any of this to use Romp.
    Describes the system as of **2026-07-24**; the behaviour it documents moves,
    so treat anything here as a snapshot rather than a contract.

Architecture deep dive. Layer 3 turns the records written by the event model
(`event-model.md`) and the summarizer layer (`docs/judges.md`) into the three
web-UI panes you look at: the **feed**, the **chat**, and the **timeline**.

## The governing principle

**Layer 3 derives no meaning. All meaning is computed below it (almost all in
Layer 2); the read side only selects and displays.** The judges write durable
meaning once; the panes are thin projections of it.

A direct consequence: the completion **rollup + "settled" gate** lives in
Layer 2. The producer publishes each goal's rolled-up status (working / blocked /
completed); the feed just paints columns. (Reflected in `docs/judges.md`.)

## The kernel and its clients

- **The kernel is the core, supervised by `romp-manager`.** One process: Layer 1
  (parse) + Layer 2 (the judges) **and** an HTTP server, single writer. Its
  *lifecycle* is owned by **`romp-manager`** — a durable, jupyter-lab-style
  supervisor, started by the login service that `install.sh` sets up, that spawns
  and respawns the kernel (via `romp-serve` → `romp-kernel`) and stays up across
  kernel restarts. Front ends
  (browser, phone, VS Code) ATTACH to the kernel; they never spawn it.
  `romp-serve` points at the Python kernel, so `romp up` supervises it on the
  manager's port (29855), and the front ends and tailscale serve attach unchanged.
- **The UI is served by the kernel.** The front-end (the three panes) is `ui/`. A
  browser hits the kernel's port and gets it.
- **The login service starts the supervisor**; `romp up` starts that service,
  or, on a machine without one, runs `romp-manager` in the foreground (like
  `jupyter lab`; `romp up --foreground` forces that for watching it work).
  `romp refresh` restarts the kernel(s), `romp down` stops them through the
  service and keeps them stopped until `romp up`, `romp status` reports them. The kernel binds loopback only; tailnet/phone reach is
  `tailscale serve` proxying to `127.0.0.1:29855` (there is no `0.0.0.0` opt-in
  door; the tailscale proxy carries the phone path). The UI itself is just a URL
  the kernel serves.
- **Session discovery keys on the rompUuid birth stamp, not a time window.** The
  kernel discovers only sessions carrying the rompUuid birth stamp the launcher
  writes — the same rompUuid registry `event-model.md` defers, which also powers
  session→files stitching. A 48h window is allowed only as a perf bound on how far
  back to parse, never as the eligibility test (a time window is a fragile proxy
  and a banned time-heuristic). The kernel does not read or migrate the legacy
  record stores (`summaries/`, `requests/`, `decision-log`, `corrections/`,
  `digest/`), so old data cannot pollute the new model. Pre-rebuild sessions
  simply never appear: no resume-picker entry, no scrollback over old history.
- **The VS Code extension is a thin client.** It speaks the kernel's WebSocket
  protocol (`vscode-extension/src/extension.ts`: "a THIN CLIENT of the romp web
  kernel", `ws://HOST:kernelPort()/ws?app=...`). Browser and extension render the
  **same served UI** over the **same protocol**, so the two front ends stay
  consistent by construction. Keeping the WS protocol stable is the compatibility
  contract.
- **The feed is pushed as one full frame, then as deltas.** A pane's socket
  receives nothing until the pane's bundle says it is listening. Every
  kernel-served pane page announces `readyGate` on its socket, because the pane
  shim opens the socket before the bundle has loaded and has no inbound buffer;
  the kernel then holds every push to that socket (pusher cycles, broadcasts, a
  reveal) until the bundle sends `ready`. A socket that does not announce
  (federation's remote relays, the VS Code extension's pipes, an older page) is
  served from accept, as it always was. Keepalives and the restart notice reach
  every socket, held or not: the shim consumes both itself. On `ready`, a feed
  socket receives the cached `{type:"feed"}` frame at once, with no build, and the
  frame's `now` is rewritten to the time of the serve. The rewrite matters because
  the pusher builds only while a client is connected: after a night with no
  dashboard open, the cached build's clock is a night old, and the pane would
  anchor every age and tint on it. The pane anchors its live clock on that `now`
  paired with the moment the frame arrived from the wire (federation stamps the
  merged frame with `nowAt`), never on the moment a frame is handed to it: the
  merged frame is re-emitted on a view-order write, on a remote host's frame and
  on a detach, and an anchor taken then moved every age back by the quiet period.
  The shim re-sends `ready` on a reconnect once the bundle has sent its own, so a
  reconnecting pane resyncs at once rather than on the pusher's next cycle; a
  redial that completes before the bundle has loaded sends nothing, and the
  bundle's own `ready` lifts the hold. A `ready` on a socket that is already
  ready is a re-base: the frame is served again rather than deduped.
  The kernel dedups per client. A client
  that announces `?caps=feedDelta` on its socket (the kernel-served feed,
  Outline and Waiting on you pages do) then receives `{type:"feedDelta"}` frames: changed cards by `itemId`, removed
  ids, the same for ledgers by `sid`, and the small top-level fields whole under
  `top` when any changed — and an unchanged board sends such a client nothing at
  all. Every other consumer — the VS Code extension's pipes,
  federation's remote sockets, an older bundle — stays on the full-frame path,
  which keeps its 60 s repost of the unchanged frame. `federation.ts` applies a
  delta onto the last full frame it holds for the host and re-emits a merged full
  frame, so every consumer still sees whole `feed` frames; a delta it cannot
  apply gets a `needFullFeed` and a re-base. A build that carries no `ledgers`
  says nothing about ledgers: the client keeps the ones it holds, and so does the
  kernel's record of them. Card age colours are computed client-side from `t` on
  a live clock (`age-color.ts`, `feed-age.ts`: the payload's `now` plus the local
  time since it landed, so a quiet board's ages and tints keep moving), never
  read from the wire. The Outline pane keeps the same clock: its ages, the
  current goal's elapsed time and its recency cutoff move on a 15 s refresh
  (skipped while the pane is hidden, with one catch-up render when it is shown
  again), since a delta client hears nothing from a quiet board. Full frames still carry the per-card `trgb` for older
  bundles that destructure it; deltas omit it, and the kernel's dedup signature
  ignores it, so a colour step is never a change (it used to re-send the whole
  board on every step: 5.76 MB a push on a board of about 660 cards, measured
  2026-09-02).
- **Liveness is a keepalive, and staleness is event-keyed.** The kernel sends a
  `ka` frame to every socket every 10 s; the pane shim force-closes a socket that
  has gone 30 s without any frame. After a reconnect the shim raises the "what you
  see may be stale" prompt only on the SECOND `ka` arriving before the resync
  frame — one full heartbeat period, bracketed by two kernel heartbeats on that
  socket with no resync between them (a single `ka` can be a beat that was already
  queued when the socket was accepted) — or on the reconnected socket closing
  again before its resync; the first non-keepalive frame retires the prompt. A
  client that falls 16 MB behind is dropped by the kernel, loudly: one `ws drop:`
  line in the kernel log, logged where the drop is decided so every send path is
  covered and naming the push slot whose frame tipped the budget when a push did,
  and a row in the dashboard's bell (at most five drop rows, none older
  than an hour, so they never crowd out a backend problem). Every close of a socket
  that opened leaves a `wsclose` breadcrumb (code, reason, socket age) in
  `client-diag.jsonl`; the redials an outage refuses are counted and reported as
  one `wsconnfail` row on the next open, and at most 20 breadcrumbs wait in the
  shim's queue for it.
- **Both judge tiers run continuously for any live session — no connection gate.**
  The kernel runs the index tier (captioner + archiver) AND the triage tier
  (planner → closer → courier → grouper → consolidator → distiller) in parallel,
  on a short event-driven backstop, whether or not a browser is attached — so the
  goal tree, feed, and timeline are already current the instant a client connects.
  A pass is cheap when nothing changed (cached parses; each judge makes an LLM call
  only on real new work), so always-on costs filesystem stats, not model calls,
  when idle. The tiers are a cost/value GROUPING (see `docs/judges.md`), not a
  runtime gate. Single process means single writer for free, no matter how many
  tabs are open.
- **Views are URL-hash tag selections.** `localhost:PORT/#work,personal` is one
  view; `#work` is another. Each browser tab is an independent view over the same
  kernel, ephemeral, zero-config, many at once. A saved default can live behind the
  settings gear.
- **Port is a per-machine config.** One fixed port the kernel binds at startup.
- **Liveness collapses to three states** (+ the user's `cleared`): **working**
  (open, nothing for you to do — including delegated work and waiting on a
  non-user trigger), **blocked** (needs *you*), **completed**. They map 1:1 onto
  the three feed columns.
- **`blocked` has a deterministic floor the judge cannot override.** A live
  permission / decision prompt is a fact, not a judgment. `blocked = hard OR soft`,
  hard wins: the planner's output can never clear a hard block. This is a merge
  rule, not a prompt instruction — the judge is told nothing special; its verdict
  simply never removes a hard block. Hard and soft rarely collide in time (the
  planner runs on *ended* segments; a live prompt sits on an *open* turn).
- **The read side has two inputs: durable judge records + a thin real-time
  live-state read.** Live state (the chip, the timeline stripes, the hard-block
  floor, "is a session mid-turn right now") comes from `states/<sid>.jsonl` + the
  event tree's open turn. It is deterministic and mechanical, not meaning-logic, so
  it does not violate the principle; it is the one thing that cannot be precomputed
  into a record because it is about *right now*.
- **Comms scope is directory-based, group-wide, alive-gated** (a design sketch —
  see below). A separate axis from view tags.
- **Tags are directory-derived, overridable.** A `directory → tag` map auto-tags a
  session at launch; a per-session manual override handles "get this out of work."
- **Hard data isolation is a separate `ROMP_STATE_DIR` root, manual, rare.** Default is
  one shared root (so views can overlap). Point a kernel at another root only when
  you genuinely need segregated data (a dedicated machine). It is free, because the
  root is already a parameter.

## The runtime picture

```
THE KERNEL  (one always-on process, single writer)
  Layer 1   parse transcripts → event tree
  Layer 2   index tier  (captioner + archiver)                      ALWAYS
            triage tier (planner/closer/courier/grouper/distiller)  ALWAYS (no connection gate)
  HTTP/WS   serve the UI + push pane payloads
  writes →  ~/.local/state/romp/   (the interface)

ROMP POSTAL SERVICE  (always-on infra, below Layer 2)  delivery never waits on a judge

CLIENTS  (0..N, pure readers, render only)
  browser tab(s)      ── each a view (URL-hash tags)
  VS Code extension   ── same WS protocol
```

The records dir is the only interface. The kernel is the only writer. Clients only
read and render. This is the producer/consumer split the whole system rests on,
collapsed into a single process for the common (one-machine) case while preserving
single-writer.

### How mail reaches a session

The bus stores mail per recipient (a Maildir) and the kernel owns the wake
(`POST /deliver`). Three delivery legs, chosen by what the recipient is:

1. **SDK session** — the kernel enqueues the banner on the session's SDK input
   queue. First-class, nothing to scrape.
2. **tmux session on Claude Code ≥ 2.1.224** — one JSON user record written to
   the session's **inbox socket**, the per-session Unix socket the CLI binds and
   registers (with its session id) in `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`. The
   kernel joins that registry on the session's current transcript id
   (`lastSid`), connects, writes one line, done: instant, wakes an idle session,
   delivers between tool calls mid-turn, and never touches the composer, so a
   half-typed draft survives with no stash dance. The CLI treats socket arrivals
   as another-session traffic; its inbound gate can HOLD mail from an
   unverifiable sender (the kernel is one) when the session runs a bypass-class
   permission mode, and a held message silently expires after ~5 minutes — and
   the socket acks nothing, so a hold would read as delivered. That is why
   `bin/romp` launches sessions with the CLI's inbound-accept setting
   (`crossSessionInbound: accept`) and tags them `@romp-inbound-accept`, and the
   kernel takes this leg ONLY for tagged sessions: the tag is written by the
   same launch that made holds impossible, so tag and setting can never
   disagree. Security shape: the socket is owner-only (0600 inside a 0700 dir),
   unreachable from off-machine and from other local users; a same-user process
   could already type into any pane via `tmux send-keys` with FULL user
   authority, while socket mail arrives explicitly labeled as peer traffic with
   approval power stripped — the lower-privilege injection path of the two.
3. **Everything else** (older CLI, untagged launch, socket gone) —
   draft-preserving pane injection at a live ❯ prompt, with the Stop-hook drain
   (`hooks/romp-postal-drain.sh`) as the turn-boundary backstop. Unchanged, and
   still the fallback whenever leg 2 fails for any reason: non-delivery is
   caught by the maildir claim/retry and stuck-mail warnings either way.

## The two inputs

1. **Durable judge records** (`docs/judges.md` writes these):
   - **captions** — per segment and per turn, keyed by id. The activity log.
   - **the goal tree** — nodes + edges + per-node and rolled-up status. The inbox.
   - **courier records** — handoff (propagating / FYI) + which sender goal, keyed by
     message/segment id. The cross-session edges.
   - **archive** — per session, keyed by rompUuid: a sub-sentence **headline** + a
     2-3 sentence **abstract**, summarized from the session's captions (cheap
     input), continuously refreshed as the session gains turns. The index + the
     TOC header.
2. **A thin real-time live-state read**: `states/<sid>.jsonl` (working / permission /
   compacting / idle / closed transitions) + the event tree's open turn. Drives the
   chip, the timeline stripes, the hard-block floor, and the mid-turn pulse.

## The three panes (each a thin projection)

Chat is a zoom into Layer 1; the feed is a zoom into Layer 2; the timeline is the
bridge that shows Layer 1 spatially with Layer 2 labels.

### Chat = the event tree, rendered directly

Per-session tabs. Renders the event tree at the Atom / ContentBlock level (one
widget per block), with **no second transcript parser** — the event model already
produced the tree. Plus the live chip from the state read, and the TOC ledger below
the tabs.

**A send stays visible from the press until its record lands, and each layer
retires on an event, never a timer.** The kernel keeps an input echo (a synthetic
user atom in the backend's live store, mirrored to the registry so a restart cannot
lose it) from `send()` until the transcript carries the same text. For a message fed
into a running turn that record is the `queued_command` attachment the CLI writes
when it splices the message in at its next tool boundary. On the SDK route no floor
retires an echo: it retires only when its text lands in a record stamped at or after
the send (a user record or that attachment), or when the CLI dies holding it
(`dropped`). The CLI extracts no image paths on the stream-json route (its only
image-path test belongs to the interactive composer's paste handler), so an image
path in an SDK send lands as typed and the echo's text matches. `_path_bearing` and
the extension set it tests (png, jpe?g, gif, webp, case-insensitive: the CLI bundle's
single image-path test, pinned equal between kernel and backend) remain for the tmux
settle path only, where the paste hook does run and rewrites the path to
`[Image #N]`. The chat's own image previews (`_user_images`) use a separate set,
built from the served MIME table (`_IMG_MIME`, svg and bmp included), so a preview is
never proposed for a file the image route cannot serve. If the CLI dies holding the
message, the echo is flagged `undelivered` and the chat offers copy-to-composer and
dismiss. A kernel restart does not re-run a mid-turn send: the boot duplicate guard
(`_text_landed`) reads the `queued_command` attachment too, and it scans from the
transcript's byte size at the moment of the send (recorded on the echo as `_echo_off`
with the file id `_echo_fsid`, mirrored in the registry as `off` and `fsid`) to the end
of the file, so a landed send is neither re-queued nor flagged as undelivered however
much the session wrote afterwards. A mark from another file (a /clear or a fork
since), a mark past the end of the file, or an echo with no mark reads the whole file.
The guard used to read a fixed 2 MB tail, which suits the lost verdict and not the
landed one: an attachment further back read as never landed, and the resumed CLI ran
the send again. The found verdict is recorded on the echo (`_landed`), and
`prune_live` and the chat merge retire the echo on it without a text match, so a found
echo always has an exit and a later boot never re-scans it. Every by-text comparison
of an echo against a record, the guard's scan, `prune_live`'s retire, the kernel's
`_atom_user_texts` and its folds, the tmux echo's prune (`_tmux_echo_prune`) and the
user-todo answer's landed check (`_paste_landed_texts`, the match set
`_user_todo_answer_lost` reads), uses one key, `echo_text_key` in
`session_backend.py` (outer whitespace stripped, nothing else). The scan used to
collapse inner whitespace while the prune compared raw text against stripped keys, so
a send with a trailing newline was found, hence neither re-fed nor flagged, and yet
never pruned or dismissable. The client keeps its own pending
bubble (dashed, "sending…") from the press until the kernel's payload accounts for
the text (`ui/webview/send-pending.ts`). At the press the bubble is anchored to the
last stable kernel event, and the user events that already carry its text are
recorded as background. Only a user atom that lands after that anchor, with exactly
the sent text, ends the bubble; the scan runs from the anchor to the end of the
resident events, never over a fixed number of tail events, so an absorbed atom placed
a hundred events above the tail still ends it. One landing ends one bubble: two
identical sends in flight end in send order, and a landing of "test the continue
button" leaves a pending "test" alone. The `undelivered` verdict ends the bubble on
the same terms, so resending a never-delivered message is not ended by the old
bubble's verdict. The kernel's echo atom or queued copy is attributed per send, as a
landing is: the k-th copy of the text after the anchor (an echo no earlier bubble
claimed, or a queued copy beyond the count the press saw) hides the k-th bubble with
that text for that push and proves the kernel received that one send. A claimed echo
is background for every later bubble with the text, so one echo confirms one send.
Identical texts carry no identity of their own, so which copy is whose goes by send
order, as it does for landings. The bubble has no lifetime. A connection drop relabels
it "not confirmed" until a copy attributed to it appears or the message lands. The
label is per bubble, so a group holding one dropped send and one in flight reads "not
confirmed · sending…". ✕ removes the bubble it sits on: the entry's press time rides
the button as `data-qts`, and `dropPending` removes that entry rather than the first
entry with the same text. The chat repaints only when a bubble's state changed (a
redial loop while the kernel is down repaints nothing). A send pressed while its tab
is still a placeholder, with no resident frame, is stamped at the first frame instead.
That stamp reads the events' own kernel stamps: only an event stamped before the
press's second is the anchor or background, so the frame's copy of this send (its
echo, or its landed atom when the CLI was idle) is read as the send's own and not as
an older message. The comparison assumes that the client's clock and the kernel
host's agree to the second; `stampBase` states the assumption. The kernel's queued
bubble carries no stamp, so a late stamp presumes that the frame's newest queued copy
of the text is this send's own (one copy per identical send pressed against the same
placeholder frame); without that, a send into a busy or held queue whose first frame
already listed it sat as a second bubble beside the kernel's copy for the whole wait,
and its ✕ would have cancelled the real queued send. The presumption misreads one
case, stated in `stampBase`: an older identical message already in the queue, with
this send not yet received when the frame was built, is read as this send's copy. A
press-time stamp reads no stamp, since its frame predates the press. An
absorbed atom sits at its send time, above the steps that were already
running, so its event carries `absorbed` and `landedAt`, the time the CLI took it:
the repaired timestamp of the attachment's file-order predecessor (the boundary
record the splice waited for), clamped to the send time when it would be earlier.
`landedT` is never before `t`, with no tolerance window: real transcripts invert only
by clock granularity, and anything larger is a shape the CLI does not write. Each
clamp is counted as `landedT-clamp` in the event model's assembly stats, served
beside `ts-repair` in the version route's `parse` dict. The chat shows the time to
the minute. The bubble wears "joined mid-turn", and when the landing retired a pending
bubble at the tail, a cue stays where the bubble was ("delivered into the running
turn at HH:MM", with a jump) until jump or ✕. The cue hangs under the last event the
chat draws in its current mode; compact mode hides thinking, so a thinking record at
the tail is skipped.

**The ledger is a table of contents** (pure projection of captions + archive):
- top: the archiver's one-sentence headline for the session,
- then **turn captions** as top-level bullets, the whole session (not just recent),
- a multi-segment turn expands to its **segment captions** indented beneath,
- click any line to jump to that point in the transcript.

The captioner emits both grains and the event model gives the turn→segment nesting,
so the TOC is free. (Caveat: a live permission prompt's *content* may exist only in
tmux, not the transcript; a live AskUserQuestion/ExitPlanMode is in the tree as an
unanswered tool_use. The chip state comes from `states/` regardless.)

### Feed = top-level-goal cards, nothing else

**The only cards are top-level goals.** One card per top-level goal, bucketed into
the three columns by the rolled-up status the producer already wrote (working /
blocked / completed). A sub-goal never gets its own card: a block anywhere in the
tree rolls UP, so the *top-level card* moves to BLOCKED and its modal shows which
leaf is blocking; likewise a completed step shows inside the modal, not as its own
Completed card. No read-time DAG rebuild, no status derivation, no handoff repair.

- A card's modal shows the goal's trail (its filed segments + sub-goal tree,
  interleaved).
- **No caption stream.** Turn/segment captions are NOT feed cards — they live in the
  card's trail, the ledger, and the timeline. The rule lives in `build_feed`.
- **Card detail**: a card shows its caption trail; a richer expand view is parked.
- **Clear-all + undo**: a button retires every currently-open top-level card at
  once (batch `cleared`); an **undo** restores that batch if invoked right after.
  For sweeping away a stale backlog you know you don't care about.

### Timeline = segments as bars, with connectors and overlays

- **Lanes**: one per session; each **segment** is a bar `[t, end]` (segments are
  exactly "what the timeline draws as a bar" in the event model), a dot at the
  trigger, idle atoms as the not-working gaps, caption on hover.
- **Stripes**: needs-input (a live permission/picker prompt) / compacting, from the state read.
- **Connectors**: postal messages between lanes, from courier records / the message
  log.
- **Overlays**: focus / hover from the feed and chat (UI ephemera, one WS channel).
- Reads **segments straight from the event model**.
- The timeline lives **in `ui/`** next to chat and feed, sharing one view-builder,
  one bundle, one set of types.

## One view-builder

A single read library (TS, in `ui/`) of pure functions `records → ChatView |
FeedView | TimelineView`. One implementation, because there is one front end.

## What stays in the read side

The read side does no meaning-work: no DAG rebuild, no status derivation, no
handoff classification or repair. Those live in Layer 1/2 — the planner un-blocks
via newest-wins, origin is `trigger.author`, the courier classifies handoffs at
write time, captions are keyed by id upstream. The completion rollup, column
derivation, and the settled gate live in Layer 2, leaving the feed to read status.
Recency fade is the one display-only heuristic the read side keeps.

## Comms scope (directory groups, alive-gated)

**Design sketch — not shipped.** What ships today is live-name addressing with
per-host trust tiers (see `SECURITY.md`); the directory-group gate below has not
been built.

At the postal/infra level, below Layer 2, keyed on the working directory. Separate
from view tags.

- Sessions in the **same directory talk freely** (one project). This fits the
  shared-worktree reality: sibling sessions in one checkout are one group.
- **Cross-directory is blocked by default.** The first attempt surfaces an approval
  to the user; approving opens a **group-wide** edge (every session in dir A ↔ every
  session in dir B), not just the two that triggered it.
- The edge is **alive-gated**: it lives while both directories have ≥1 live session
  and tears down when either empties, so it re-asks next time. Event-based, no
  timer. ("Allow personal and work to talk today; tomorrow they're separate again.")
- A **config allowlist** (directory-pairs or tag-pairs) permanently bypasses the
  gate for pairs you always want open.
- **Agent norm**: sessions should not attempt cross-directory messages unless the
  user directs it; an unsanctioned attempt surfaces the approval prompt rather than
  delivering silently or failing silently.

## Tags and views

A tag is a named, colored set of sessions. The kernel stores tags in
`timeline-views.json` (name, color, members, and `tagOrder`, the order the user
has dragged the tags into); a session may carry several, and a tag may span
attached kernels, joined by name. Tags are edited from a tab's context menu, the
timeline's tag table, the picker's **Tags** row, and `romp tag`. They do three
jobs:

- **Filtering.** Each surface (chat tabs, timeline lanes, outline) keeps its own
  lens: every session, the untagged ones, or any set of tags.
- **Grouping.** The chat tab strip sections by tag whenever a session carries
  one: a header per tag in `tagOrder`, each tab under the first of its tags in
  that order (its home tag), the untagged after a divider. Sections fold per
  browser; dragging a header reorders `tagOrder` for every surface; **Move to
  <tag>** in a tab's menu adds the target tag and drops the home tag in one
  click. Groups are tags: there is no second store and no per-session group
  field.
- **Inheritance.** A session spawned from another joins the parent's tags at the
  creation event: a fork, a promoted comment thread, and `romp new` run inside a
  session (it sends its `ROMP_SID` as `parent`; `--no-inherit` withholds it and
  `--in <tag>` adds tags; a thread's `ROMP_SID` resolves to the session the
  thread belongs to). Opening a running session inherits nothing: `/new`
  re-asserts an explicit `--in` on it, while the picker's createSession op
  warns and leaves the running session's tags alone, because its Tags row is a
  prefill from the active tab rather than an ask. A comment thread inherits
  nothing until it is promoted, since it has no tab. Only the local kernel's
  tags are inherited; a parent held only by a remote kernel's tag is a known gap.
  Every writer of the views blob, the WS `setTimelineViews` full-blob write
  included, runs under `_views_lock`.

Every dashboard write of the views blob is acknowledged on the socket that posted
it. A tag edit from the timeline's tag table, its lane gear menu, or a tab's Tags
flyout is one `tagEdit` WS op, `{writeId, edit: {op, tid, …}}`, where `op` is
create, rename, recolor, addMember, removeMember, delete or move. It is applied
through the same read-modify-write merge as `romp tag`, so the stale-writer guard
never refuses it. Every op but create names the tag by its stored id, never by
name; a create takes an optional name, and the kernel mints the id and, given no
name, the lowest free "tag N". A move (off one tag, onto another) is one write:
both halves land or neither does. The kernel answers `tagEditAck` with `ok`, the
post-write client blob, the tag's `tid` and `name`, or a plain refusal. A lens or
order change still posts the whole blob (`setTimelineViews`) together with
`edited`, the tag ids the write changed (none for a lens or order write).
`edited` bounds what the write may change. An empty list changes no tag: the
store's tags stand whatever tags the blob carries, and only the lens, order and
active fields land, with nothing judged and nothing logged (a lens write built
from a copy taken in the same second as a targeted edit used to revert that
edit, since the guard's stamps have one-second resolution). A list of ids may
change those tags only; a differing copy of any other tag, or its absence, is
kept from the store and listed in the ack. The guard may also keep the store's
copy of a stale edited tag; the kernel answers `viewsAck` listing each kept tag
with a reason, and `ok` is false only when a kept tag is one the client edited.
The kernel's own dashboard notice follows the same rule: a kept tag the client
edited is a lost edit and raises a dashboard notice; a kept tag it did not edit
is one stderr line and nothing on the dashboard. A write without `edited` (an
older client) is judged whole by the stamps, as before.
The lens, order and active fields are not judged under any value of `edited`:
the write's copies land whole, with no comparison of its `seq` or `at` to the
store's, so across dashboards the last writer wins for them. They are display
preferences a user sets by gesture, not tag data, and a surface's lens should
read as the last gesture made on it. The cost is stated here rather than
hidden: a dashboard whose adopted base predates another dashboard's lens
change carries the older lenses for the other surfaces along with its own
change and writes them back, so the other dashboard's filter reverts on its
next frame. Tightening this would mean naming the surfaces a write changed,
the way `edited` names tags. The one check made is on `active`: it is
validated against the tags that stand after the write, so a stale copy whose
active names a tag deleted since stores "all", not a dangling id.
`edited` also settles a case the guard could not judge before: a tag absent
from the store. Named in `edited`, it is a create (the no-capability path's
client-minted `g…` id) and lands; not named, it is a stale copy re-creating a
tag another dashboard deleted, and is kept out with a reason. A write without
`edited` keeps every unknown tag as new. The door also refuses a tag renamed to,
or created under, a name another tag in the resulting set holds, with a reason
naming the collision: a renamed tag stands as the store has it and keeps its claim
on that name, so a tag created under it in the same write is refused too; a new one
is kept out. Names address edits, so the store holds one tag per name, and a
name is clamped and stripped at both doors, so a padded spelling is the same
name. The store caps at 32 tags, and the cap never drops a kept store tag: when
the tags that stand after a write would exceed it, the write's own creates are
refused instead, last in array order first, each with a reason naming the cap
(`_edit_tag` refuses a 33rd create the same way). The door reads a posted blob
to 64 tags, so a 33rd reaches that pass, and a posted entry with a valid id
past that bound is always reported. The first 64 such entries get a row each:
one the store lacks is not created ("a write is read to 64 tags and it was past
that bound, so it was not created"), one the store holds keeps the store's copy
("a write is read to 64 tags and its copy was past that bound, so the store's
copy was kept"). Past those 64, the rest are counted in one summary row with no
`tid` or `name`, `{reason, more, moreEdited}`, whose reason reads "N more
entries past the 64-tag read bound were not read", with " (M of them this write
edited)" appended when `edited` names any of them; the reason stands on its own
because it can lead the ack's one-line `error`. The bound exists because the rows,
the loud notice and the ack's `error` all grew with the posted array: a
100k-entry post drew an ack of about 22 MB, which overran the socket's queue
and dropped the poster's own socket. Every unread store tag is kept, wherever
its copy sat past the read bound, and nothing past the read bound is stored. A
duplicate entry consumes a slot. `ok` is false when a refused tag is one
`edited` names or the summary row counts one (`moreEdited`), and on any refusal
when the write carries no `edited`. The ack's one-line `error` leads with the
rows for the tags `edited` names (or the summary row when it counts one), then
the rest, joined with "; " (a nameless row is its reason alone) up to 1000
characters, then "and N more"; without `edited` the rows appear in the judge's
order. The rows carry every reason in full and are never reordered; a client
composes the same shape from them, in their order, when the line is absent.
Until round 9 of the 2026-09-05 review the line followed the judge's order,
which files rows in the posted array's order, quiet (kept copies of tags the
poster did not edit) and loud interleaved, with the cap pass last, so with
enough quiet rows ahead of it the bound cut the one row that made `ok` false
and the line named only tags the poster never edited. The loud notice gives the
count of refused tags and lists each with its cause. A remote tag's rendered name is on the
same stored basis (clamped, then stripped; "tag" when empty) as the lens and
order entries, so a padded name a remote kernel serves raw reads as the name a
lens stores: a lens can select it, and it joins the union of a local tag of that
name. A lens or order write (`edited: []`) touches no tag whatever the blob carries and
files none of these rows; it is built from the store's blob the client last
adopted plus the fields it sets. It never carries a targeted edit still in
flight, which is that edit's own claim; the copy the client shows keeps such
edits, and a refusal of one reverts it alone. Both acks carry the write's `writeId` and the blob's `seq`.

`seq` is the store's write sequence. `_set_timeline_views` stamps every accepted
write with a number greater than the last (seeded from the clock, so a store
recreated from nothing starts past what any connected client holds), and every
frame that embeds the blob (the timeline skeleton, the feed frame, the tabOrder
frames) carries it. A client adopts a blob only when its `seq` is at least the
one it holds, or when either side carries no seq, so a frame the pusher built
from its warmed cache before a write cannot replace the ack's newer blob,
whatever order the socket delivered them in. The gate keeps the last blob it
turned away and lets it go on its next adoption; the caps frame is the one
event that adopts a kept blob, and the one that announces a seq at which the
gate adopts a later blob even below the held one. The optimistic copy a gesture shows clears
on the ack; a refusal reverts
its own write at once and shows the reason (a notice in the dialog and the lane
gear menu, a toast in the chat pane), and a later write still in flight keeps
its change: the copy is re-derived from the store's blob plus the remaining
writes. Each surface allows one create in flight at a time: the dialog's
[+ New tag] reads "creating…" and the new-tag inputs are disabled until the
ack. The row the create draws meanwhile takes no gesture (no rename, delete,
recolor, drag, join, or move) until the ack names the tag's id. The join menu's
new-tag draft belongs to the open [+], survives repaints however the listed rows
change, and is dropped when the menu or the dialog closes. No count
of frames settles a write. The one frame-driven clear left is the exact-echo
match, kept together with the old three-frame yield for blobs without a `seq`:
a kernel from before the stamp acks nothing.

Reader-side rules keep the sequence consistent. A store from before the stamp
is stamped once on its first read, so the gate protects the first write after
an upgrade (a store that does not exist is left alone: its first write starts
past whatever a client holds). The same first read gives every tag the file
holds an mtime (the file's `at`, else the time of the stamp), and the
hidden-to-archived migration does the same for the tags it carries over, so
every stored tag carries the mark that tells it from a client's own create.
That stamp is the file's last write time, not each tag's own (a legacy store
recorded no per-tag time, so there is nothing truer to use), and it has a
one-time cost: a whole-blob writer whose copy predates the store's last
pre-upgrade write is refused on any legacy tag it edits, even one that write
never touched, because the guard compares the tag's mtime to the writer's
evidence. The refusal is loud, the client adopts the ack's blob, and its next
write carries the new `at`, so it happens once per stale copy; a copy taken
at that last write lands (the comparison is strict). Targeted edits read the
store first and are never affected. For the first-read stamp and the migration
the file is normalized under the disk cap of 32 before the judge sees it, as
every read normalizes what it serves, so a read never runs the door's
create-refusal pass and never files a refusal worded as a dashboard's. What the
cap leaves out is named once per file state, in a sync notice worded as a fact
about the file, whether or not the stamp's write lands. The count holds when
readers race: a reader that waited for the file lock re-checks the read cache
under it and serves the blob the first reader judged and cached, so when two
readers that start with the cache empty race on a full disk, the notice is
filed once. Until round 9 of the 2026-09-05 review each judged the file, failed
the write and filed it. The notice is a
template that puts the cause and the count first and the dropped tags after.
It opens "the views file held N tags, over the store's 32-tag cap; no dashboard
wrote this." When the stamp was written it continues "K tags were dropped when
it was re-stamped on read (<why the file was stamped>): " and lists the dropped
tags, each with its member count. When the stamp's write failed (an unwritable
or full state dir) it continues "Its re-stamp could not be written — K tags are
not served and are lost at the next write unless the file is brought under the
cap first: " and the same list, because the served blob is what the next write
persists. The verbs agree with the count: one tag reads "1 tag was dropped" and
"1 tag is not served and is lost". Stderr carries the notice and every dropped
tag's members. The judge
carries a `writer` label apart from `foreign`, because `foreign` is also the
judging mode for unknown tags and would refuse every freshly stamped tag as a
re-creation. The loud notice is a template of the same shape: the writer, the
count and the remedy first, the refused tags after. It reads "<writer> was
partially refused: its changes to N tags were not applied and the store's state
was kept; <remedy>. Refused: " and then each refused tag with its cause. The
writer is "a stale dashboard write", "a stale write to the views file from
outside the kernel" or "the views file's re-stamp on read". The remedy is
offered only when there is something to reload: "reload that dashboard to
resync" for a dashboard's, "reload the panel that wrote it to resync" for a
foreign file's, and none for the re-stamp's, whose head ends at "kept." One tag
reads "its changes to 1 tag were not applied". Each label carries its cause:
"(stale copy)", "(deletion)", "(re-creation)", "(unread)", "(name collision)"
or "(over the cap)". The quiet stderr line for kept tags the client did not
edit carries the same kind of label on every tag, "(differing copy)" among
them; until round 9 of the 2026-09-05 review a kept differing copy was the one
entry on it without a cause. Both notices bound their lists to fit the 240 characters
the dashboard's bell shows, under the 300 the kernel serves (`SYNC_NOTICE_FIT`,
`_notice_list`): as many entries as fit, then "and M more" for the rest, and
when not even the first fits, the head alone, which carries the count. Until
round 8 of the 2026-09-05 review both notices put the cause clause and the
remedy last, after one entry per tag, and with two or more tags the bell cut
them away. A file written
outside the kernel (the timeline's Electron branch writes `timeline-views.json`
itself, with the seq it holds) can carry a seq behind the last one served. By its own seq the writer
held an older copy, so the reader judges the file against the last served blob
through the stale-writer guard, then re-stamps it past that seq: a tag deleted
since is not brought back (an unknown tag carrying an mtime existed in a store
once; one without is the writer's own create and lands), a member added since
is kept, and each refusal is reported through the sync notice. With nothing
served, the file is ordered as written: the highest seq the kernel has served
or written outlives the read cache's entry (a store read as missing forgets the
entry), so a file restored from an older copy is still re-stamped past it, and
every write orders past it. A kernel write also refreshes the read
cache with the blob it wrote, so the ack's blob is never a stale cache hit. The
hidden-to-archived migration works on a copy of the file, so the tag it fills
is stamped and a pre-migration copy cannot strip it. It finds an existing
archived tag on the stored name basis (a padded spelling is the same tag), so
the hidden entries land in it rather than in a second archived tag the
collision pass would refuse. When the re-stamp write
itself fails (an unwritable or full state dir), the read serves the judged
blob when the file was judged (the judgment is a step apart from the write,
so the refused foreign copy is neither served nor cached, and the next write
that lands persists the judged state) and the file as read otherwise, logs
once per distinct error, and stops retrying until the file changes or a
write succeeds.

The kernel announces what it can do in a `{type: "caps", caps, viewsSeq}` frame
in reply to every `ready` and lists the caps on `/version`; `tagEdit` covers the
targeted op, the acks and the `seq`. A client uses the targeted op only when the
cap is present and posts the whole blob otherwise. A message no handler takes is
answered `{type: "unknownOp", op, writeId}`, which the client treats as a refusal
of that write and as withdrawing the cap. The caps frame is also the reconnect
signal, and the `ready` handler sends it after its own connect push. `viewsSeq`
is the write seq of the views blob that push put on the socket: the tabOrder
frame's, the timeline skeleton's or the feed frame's, the highest when the push
carried more than one. When the push carried no views frame (a chat page that
reconnects on a sentinel cycle gets no tabOrder), it is the store's current
seq at the time of the caps frame, the seq the next push serves. It is null
only when the store has no seq: no store at all, or a legacy store whose first
stamp could not be written. The kernel reads a
served seq from the frames the handler's own thread enqueued, so a write
landing between the push and the caps frame does not skew it, and a
pusher-thread frame is never what it names. A client applies one rule to the
frame. It adopts the blob its gate kept when that blob's seq equals `viewsSeq`
and discards the kept blob otherwise. When nothing kept matches, a numeric
`viewsSeq` is remembered as the seq the kernel announced for its current store:
one slot per store, overwritten by each caps frame and cleared by the client's
next adoption that changes the held blob. An adoption counts as changing it
when the blob arrives at a seq other than the held one, without a seq, or at
the announced seq itself; a re-arrival of the blob the client already holds,
at the same seq, is otherwise not new information and leaves the slot
standing. A later blob whose seq equals the announced seq is
adopted even below the held one, because the kernel said at connect which store
it holds and a blob carrying that seq is that store, not a stale frame. Null
and a missing field announce nothing; a frame without the field still adopts
the kept blob outright (a kernel from before the field). The kernel's seq floor
lives for its process, so a store restored from an older copy while the kernel
was down is served under its old seq after the restart. A page that stayed open
holds the higher seq. When its connect push carried the blob, the gate turns
the push away and keeps it, the caps frame names that blob, and the restored
store is adopted on the caps frame itself, with nothing to wait for. When the
push carried no blob, nothing is kept to match, and the announced seq covers
it: the pusher's next frame carries the restored store under that seq and is
adopted, and a frame at any other lower seq is still turned away. A pusher
frame built before a concurrent write carries a seq older than the connect
push's, so whether it lands before the caps frame (kept, then discarded) or
after it (turned away), it is never adopted: the gate is never open. Clearing
the slot when the held blob changes rules out a wrong adoption later: a write
that lands first stamps the store past the announced seq (a write's seq is
seeded from the clock), and a frame at the announced seq is then stale. Writes still
in flight when the caps frame arrives cannot be answered, so the client drops
them after that adoption, reverts the copy to the adopted base, and says so. A
remote kernel's caps frame describes that kernel and is dropped by the
federation router before it reaches a pane. The router's own two replayed
stores, the merged tabOrder's blob and the merged lanes payload's, keep, adopt
and remember by the same rule. A store that adopted on the caps frame re-emits
before it hands the frame on: a pane sees the local blob only through those
re-emits, so the restored blob must meet the pane's own gate, and be turned
away there, before the pane's caps door adopts it. A pane fills the same
announced slot from the same frame. The router re-emits on a remote host's
push or lanes payload, a `closed` frame, a view-order storage event and a host
drop; every merged re-emit between that frame and the pusher's next one hands
the pane the router's stored blob at the pane's own held seq, and that
re-arrival leaves the pane's slot standing, so when the router adopts the
pusher's frame at the announced seq and re-emits it, the pane adopts it by the
same rule. Until round 9 of the
2026-09-05 review any adoption cleared the slot, so a re-emit in that window
cleared the pane's; the pane turned the restored store away while the router
held it, and the two diverged until the next write.

The Outline pane's tag filter posts its lens the same way: the frame copy it
holds with only the outline lens changed, with a `writeId` and `edited: []`, so
the kernel applies the lens only. It ignores the ack and settles from the next
feed frame.

Until 2026-09-05 the dialog posted the whole blob for every edit from its own
un-echoed copy, so the guard refused a rename typed right after a create against
the dialog's own first write, the refusal reached only stderr and the sync
notices, and the dialog dropped its copy after three frames; renames and
assignments made in a burst were lost.

The exact project directory still defines the **comms group** sketched above.
The directory-to-tag auto-tagging rule and the URL-hash view selection once
planned here did not ship; the per-surface lens took the hash's place.

## The UI progress surface

When the kernel is catching up on a backlog (an old session opened that needs its
goals judged, or a burst of new activity), it is judging segments it hasn't judged
yet. The UI shows a **progress indicator** ("re-judging…", N pending) so the inbox
filling in is legible rather than mysterious. The kernel exposes the
pending-judgment count; the UI renders it.

## Remote kernels + postal federation

- **Each machine runs its own kernel** (its own records, its own indexing). Records
  stay local to the machine that produced them.
- **Postal federates over SSH.** Local and remote sessions share one bus address; a
  remote session tunnels the bus port to the laptop with `ssh -R
  PORT:127.0.0.1:PORT` and heartbeats for presence (`postal/postal_service.py`), so
  messages cross machines.
- **Viewing remote sessions**: shipped as read-federation — link a remote kernel
  and its sessions appear as `host:name` tabs and timeline lanes in the one local
  dashboard, sharing the feed (the guide's "Linking kernels on other machines"
  covers setup).
- **Comms across machines**: gated per host by trust tier (trusted / directed /
  isolated — see `SECURITY.md`), not by the directory-group sketch above.

## Serve-layer security (auth / CSRF hardening)

Binding `127.0.0.1` is not an auth boundary: any webpage the user opens can reach
localhost, and WebSockets are not covered by CORS, so without origin checks a
malicious page can open `ws://127.0.0.1:PORT/ws` and drive the kernel (inject
prompts, spawn/interrupt sessions). This is the ClawJacked class (CVE-2026-25253).
The Python kernel (`kernel/kernel.py`) closes it.

- **Always-on Origin/Host validation (token-independent).** Validate `Origin` and
  `Host` on every HTTP request AND the `/ws` upgrade; allow only the kernel's own
  origin plus known local client origins (the browser at the kernel's host, the
  `vscode-webview://` extension, the timeline), reject everything cross-site. This
  kills ClawJacked for free; legit local clients send the right Origin/Host.
- **Token REQUIRED on every gated route, loopback included** (Jupyter's model:
  loopback is one network stack shared by every local UID, so the `0600` token
  file — not the socket — is the same-user trust boundary; the gate keeps a
  same-host co-tenant out of `/send` and the bus). Accepted forms: `?token=`
  (browser bootstrap, seeds a `SameSite=Strict` cookie so it never re-prompts),
  the cookie, and `X-Romp-Token` (CLI/hooks/daemons, read from the file). The
  token is baked into how the kernel launches (env/autostart), never a manual
  per-launch flag; a bare browser open of `/` gets a paste-the-token login page
  (bare `romp` prints the link + opens a browser). Only the no-side-effect liveness
  probes are exempt (`/healthz`, `/version`, `/busy`; bus `/ping`) so liveness
  never breaks token-less monitors. `tailscale serve` traffic needs the token
  once per device like any browser — and funnel (public internet through the
  same proxy) must still never be enabled for this port, since the token would
  then be the only gate with no device identity in front of it.
- Regression tests: a cross-site `/ws` upgrade with a foreign `Origin` must be
  rejected, and a token-less loopback request to any gated route must 403
  (tests/test_kernel_auth_hardening.py, tests/test_kernel_ws_auth.py,
  tests/test_postal_token.py).

## Naming

- **kernel** — the one always-on core (Layer 1 + Layer 2 + HTTP/WS serving).
- **ui/** — the front-end package (the three panes).
- **Romp Postal Service** — always-on messaging infra, below Layer 2.
