# The markdown viewer: reading a note as GitHub and Obsidian show it

**Status: BUILDING. Approved by the user on 2026-09-07 with rulings on all eight decisions**, recorded
under Decisions as rulings; exact table and code mapping became Slice 8 by ruling 7. Being built by a
dedicated romp session as eight fork PRs in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, each through an
adversarial review and a full test sweep; a "The Slice N build" note under a slice records where the
code as built departs from this text and why. Six-lens audit at the fork's origin/main 1e829313
(2026-09-07), each of the 75 findings reproduced in headless Chromium; the raw findings stay outside the
repo. File and line references describe the fork at that audit commit; as with every plans/ document,
treat them as dated. Excluded as in flight at audit time: text size, fluid width and table reflow
(fork PR #348) and links inside viewed files (fork PR #347); the slices build on both.

## Summary

When built, a note in the viewer reads as on GitHub or in Obsidian: headings show structure, tables
and figures keep their shape at any width, front matter, callouts, math, footnotes and wikilinks
render as written, heading links jump, a session's edit never moves the reader, comments anchor on
any passage, and every failure says what happened.

The audit confirmed 75 defects, nine high; eight slices fix them, each useful alone and about one
session-day. The user ruled on the eight decisions the audit raised; the rulings are recorded under
Decisions and the slices below are written to them.

## Why now

The rendered view uses the chat's markdown rules, tuned for short replies, and the sanitizer trusts
a note's HTML. This view is now where the user reads a session's report, comments on it and accepts
its changes; two high defects hit that loop: the Comments panel never folds (380px pane: 209px body
beside a 171px panel), and a reload after a session's write loses the reader's place.

## Defects

### High

- **Comments aside never folds** (`ui/webview/styles.css:3741`, `feed.css:1569`): `.fileview-main`
  is both container and subject; the only test (`file-comments.test.ts:854`) matches CSS text.
- **Reload after a session edit loses the place** (`file-view.ts:948`). `replaceChildren` with no
  scroll bookkeeping; 20 paragraphs inserted above moved the top passage from 25 to 5.
- **Heading scale collapses** (`styles.css:3697`). h1 16.9px, h2 14.95, h3 13.65, h4 13 (equal to
  `strong`), h5 10.79, h6 8.71; no bottom rules.
- **Table cells break mid-word** (`styles.css:3691`). `overflow-wrap: anywhere` inherits into th/td;
  at 380px cells read "C/ol/u/m/n".
- **A note's HTML restyles the page** (`file-view.ts:1688`, `render.ts:1095`). DOMPurify keeps
  `<style>`, `style` and `id`; a `<style>` block blanked the page, a fixed div covered the close
  button.
- **A form in a note navigates the pane away** (`file-view.ts:1688`). `<form action=...><button>`
  submits; the Files document leaves for the action URL.
- **Front matter renders as a rule and an h2** (`file-view.ts:1685`). Every Obsidian note opens with
  `<hr>` and its keys as a setext heading.
- **An unclosed HTML wrapper swallows later blocks for comments** (`anchor-map.ts:756`). After `<div
  align=center>` or `<details>`, later selections are refused as "an HTML block".
- **No heading ids, no outline; `#section` links open a blank tab** (`file-view.ts:1696`). 0 of 31
  headings carry an id; every `a[href]` gets `target=_blank`.

### Medium

The Rendered/Raw toggle drifts about 600px (`file-view.ts:948`); a sized `<img>` is squashed
(`styles.css:3724`); the modal title bar clips at 380px (`styles.css:3544`); the Comment float
ignores body scroll (`file-comments.ts:1598`); the note bar scrolls away with the body
(`file-view.ts:874`); task items show bullet plus checkbox (`styles.css:3698`);
light-theme notes are monospace (`styles.css:275`); math renders only from the chat
(`render.ts:103`); fenced code lacks a wrap gutter and Copy, ten grammars (`file-view.ts:1699`);
table alignment is discarded (`styles.css:3722`); print gives one clipped grey page
(`files-pane.css:6`); Obsidian syntax stays literal: `[[Note]]`, `![[img]]`, `==mark==`,
`> [!note]`, `[^1]` (`file-view.ts:81`); inline math makes its paragraph uncommentable in the chat
pane (`anchor-map.ts:514`); code-line comments containing `*`, `_` or `#` never paint
(`anchor-map.ts:1034`); table cells and code refuse Rendered selection (`anchor-map.ts:873`); a
highlight in a closed `<details>` is unreachable (`file-comments.ts:2322`); the viewer never takes
focus (`file-view.ts:766`); scroll position is lost across file switches
(`file-view.ts:484`); a render exception dumps the source as one unannounced paragraph
(`file-view.ts:1689`); a missing figure shows a wordless broken-image glyph (`file-view.ts:1738`);
browser and host disagree on BOM offsets; Save drops the BOM (`tools/file-comments-host.mjs:724`); a
failed reload never tells the seam; the panel waits 15 s (`file-view.ts:1566`).

### Low

Pane bar 96px tall at 380px (`files-pane.css:26`); code-comment colour 2.86:1
(`styles.css:81`); th fill 1.08:1, no striping (`styles.css:3721`); 1.4em list gutter
(`styles.css:3698`); 13px type, 125-character measure, left-pinned (`styles.css:3691`); `<kbd>`
unstyled (`styles.css:160`); tab-size 8 versus Raw's 4 (`styles.css:3716`);
`video`/`audio`/`source` src not rewritten (`file-view.ts:1738`); remote images fetch on open
(`file-view.ts:1741`); `:emoji:` literal (`file-view.ts:81`); a Raw comment across two cells never
paints (`anchor-map.ts:1049`); overlapping marks nest (`anchor-map.ts:1027`); a refusal
names a later obstacle (`anchor-map.ts:871`); paintAll passes no hint (`file-comments.ts:1824`); a
keyboard selection never offers Comment (`file-view.ts:995`); no open-at-heading or offset
(`path-links.ts:123`); a Latin-1 file loses Edit silently (`file-view.ts:917`); an empty file is a
blank pane (`file-view.ts:1685`); a changed file goes unnoticed, panel closed (`file-view.ts:1506`);
a CR-only file is one Raw row (`file-view.ts:1652`).

## Proposals

CSS lands byte-equal in both sheets (the parity test); layout is asserted in headless Chromium
(browser legs), not by matching CSS text.

### Slice 1: sanitize as GitHub does

`FORBID_TAGS: style, form, button, select, textarea` and `FORBID_ATTR: id, name` (`style` per
decision 6) in both sanitizers; `contain: layout` on `.fileview-md`; a delegated `submit`
preventDefault. Acceptance: sanitized fixtures hold no `<style>`, `<form>` or `id`; over the fixed
div, `elementFromPoint` at the close button's centre returns the button; clicking the form fixture
leaves `location.href` unchanged; a task checkbox still renders. Tests: source pins; one browser leg.

### Slice 2: layout follows the pane, reader keeps their place

`container-type: inline-size` moves to `.fileview`; `overflow-anchor: none` on the body; renderBody
restores the top-visible block's source offset across a swap; `height: auto` on figures; the Comment
float hides on body scroll. Acceptance: at 380 and 640 `.fileview-main` computes `flex-direction:
column` with a pane-wide body; a reload inserting 20 paragraphs above keeps the top block; the
Rendered/Raw round trip returns to the same scrollTop; a 3:1 picture with sized attributes renders
3:1; every bar button sits inside the card at 380px; the note bar, mounted above the main row,
survives body scroll. Tests: browser legs replacing the text assertion at
`file-comments.test.ts:854`.

### Slice 3: a document type scale

A GitHub heading scale, h5 and h6 dimmed at 1em, h1 and h2 ruled; a `--font-doc` token (decision 3);
2em list gutter; bullet-less task items with `accent-color` and `color-scheme`; th weight 600,
`--overlay-05` fill, even-row striping; `[align]` honoured; `<kbd>` styling; `tab-size: 4`; an
`@media print` block; the chat's `wrapCodeLines` and `addCopyBtn` shared with mdBlock, plus decision
5's grammars. Acceptance: h1 to h4 compute 2, 1.5, 1.25 and 1em; a task item computes `list-style:
none`; a `:---:` column computes `text-align: center`; `--hl-cmt` on the code background measures
4.5:1 or more; a long note prints multi-page in black; every fence has a gutter and Copy;
anchor-map paints across `.cl` spans. Tests: computed-style leg; wrapped-code anchor-map fixture.

### Slice 4: one markdown configuration, Obsidian constructs included

A `md-config.ts` imported by render.ts, file-view.ts and anchor-map.ts registers gfm, the
double-tilde del rule, math (decision 1), front matter (a token spanning the block exactly, rendered
folded), footnotes, heading ids with GitHub slugs and in-body scrolling for `#` hrefs, callouts as
titled blocks, `==mark==`, wikilinks and embeds (decision 2), and `video`/`audio`/`source` in
`rewriteFigureSrcs`. Extensions, not string preprocessing: anchor-map lexes the same source.
Acceptance: each construct's fixture renders its element, `.katex` included in the files bundle;
anchor-map maps a paragraph after front matter and after a footnote definition to its source offset;
a `#section` click scrolls `.fileview-body` and opens no tab. Tests: render and anchor-map fixtures;
a metafile check (math.ts in files.js).

### Slice 5: comments anchor on real notes

Pair blocks inside an unclosed HTML container (a flattened walk); match code quotes raw; math tokens
as holes, no token names in refusals; report the first obstacle in document order; open `<details>`
ancestors in goTo; overlapping `.fc-hl` keep one wash and a click opens every card under it; paintAll
hints with the last located start; strip cell delimiters from a table quote; offer Comment on
`selectionchange`. Acceptance: selections after the wrapper and details containers map; the `total =
a * b * 2` comment paints in Rendered; the math paragraph maps around the formula; a Raw comment
across two cells paints; a keyboard selection offers Comment. Tests: anchor-map and file-comments
fixtures.

### Slice 6: reaching a section without scrolling

`.fileview-body` takes `tabindex=0` and focus after paint unless the composer holds it; an Outline
action lists headings by level; per-path scroll memory, persisted with the Recent entry;
`openFileView(path, sid, { at })` (line, offset or heading) through the viewFile relay, sharing the
in-file link route's `:line` grammar (fork PR #347); a HEAD on focus and visibilitychange, showing
"Changed on disk: Reload" when the mtime moved. Acceptance: PageDown moves scrollTop with no prior
click; choosing the 40th heading in Outline puts it at the top; a note reopened from Recent returns
to its scrollTop; a todo link with a heading target opens at that heading; a moved mtime on focus
shows the note bar.

### Slice 7: every failure says what happened

The render catch shows Raw rows under a `.fileview-err` line; a failed figure shows an inline error
naming its src; every failure path fires the paint hooks and the seam exposes `error()`; the host
strips the BOM and the kernel re-prepends it on save; a Latin-1 file's note bar says why Edit is off;
an empty file says so; Raw splits rows on CR, CRLF and LF. Acceptance: every case shows text, never
a blank or bare glyph; `mode()` answers raw after a thrown render; a failed reload ends the panel's
wait at once; change marks paint on a BOM file whose saved bytes still begin EF BB BF; a three-line
CR-only file gives three Raw rows. Tests: file-view, seam, host;
`tests/test_kernel_file_comments_save.py`.

### Slice 8: a cell and a code line are commentable from Rendered (ruling 2026-09-07, decision 7)

Exact mapping for tables and fenced code: the anchor map learns how marked lays out a table cell and a
code line, so a selection made in the Rendered view inside either maps to the note's source offsets
and the highlight lands on the right occurrence; the Raw fallback stays for shapes the map still
refuses. Large; built directly after Slice 5, with Slice 5's test files extended. Acceptance: a
comment on a cell and on a code line made from Rendered paints in both views after a reload; a
selection spanning two cells is refused with the reason named.

## Decisions

1. **Math everywhere or nowhere.** KaTeX adds about 270KB of script and 25KB of CSS to the files
   and feed bundles; nowhere drops it from the chat. Ruling (2026-09-07): everywhere; KaTeX ships
   in the files and feed bundles too, so a note's math renders wherever the note is shown.
2. **Wikilink resolution.** No vault root is known: `<dir>/Note.md`, an upward `.obsidian/`
   search, or an unclickable styled span. Ruling (2026-09-07): `[[Note]]` resolves to
   `<dir>/Note.md` beside the note and clicks through the in-file link route (fork PR #347); a
   wikilink that does not resolve renders as an unclickable styled span.
3. **Light-theme face.** The 2026-08-31 monospace ruling applied to viewed notes, or a sans
   `--font-doc` token in both themes. Ruling (2026-09-07): a `--font-doc` token, sans in both
   themes; the 2026-08-31 monospace ruling was about chat output, not viewed notes.
4. **Reading measure.** A centred column near 80ch at about 15px, or the left-pinned column the
   text-size change (fork PR #348) makes fluid. Ruling (2026-09-07): a centred column near 80ch
   at about 15px, scaled by #348's text-size control.
5. **Grammars.** Ten are registered; rust, go, c, java, sql and toml cost 3 to 12KB each. Ruling
   (2026-09-07): add those six; others on request.
6. **Inline `style`.** Strip it as GitHub does (existing coloured spans go plain), or keep
   colour-only declarations through a DOMPurify hook. Ruling (2026-09-07): keep colour and
   background-colour declarations through the hook and strip every other property, so coloured
   spans in existing notes survive and layout or positioning styles cannot reach the page.
7. **Exact mapping for tables and code** (large), so cells and code lines map from Rendered, or
   the designed refusals with Raw fallback. Exact mapping means teaching the anchor map how
   marked lays out a table cell or a code line, so a selection made in the Rendered view inside
   one maps back to the note's source offsets; today such a selection is refused and the person
   comments from the Raw view. It is a slice of its own by size, not a lesser priority. Ruling
   (2026-09-07): build it as Slice 8, directly after Slice 5, with the same acceptance shape (a
   cell and a code line commentable from Rendered, the highlight landing on the right
   occurrence).
8. **Remote images.** Load on open (a tracking pixel fires), gate behind a click naming the host,
   or proxy through the kernel. Ruling (2026-09-07): an allowlist of hosts loads on open
   (github.com and its image hosts, the kernel's own /file route, localhost), and every other
   host is gated behind one click that names it; the list is editable in the gear and the gate
   remembers a host the person allowed for the session.

## Out of scope

Text size, fluid width, table reflow, whole-word cells (fork PR #348); path and http links in files,
the `:line` suffix (fork PR #347); the PDF viewer; emoji shortcodes; another parser; editing the rendered
view in place; the two audit items its refuters overturned.
