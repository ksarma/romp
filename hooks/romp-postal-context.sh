# own instructions + descriptions. Now it emits only the essentials the session
# needs up front, and defers the full guide (shell CLI, remote-machine setup,

# non-tmux sessions get nothing (gated on @romp); SDK sessions get the norms from
# the postal MCP's own instructions instead. Keep this in sync with SKILL.md.

You're in a romp session with sibling sessions you can message: use the postal MCP tools (send_message, list_agents, set_working, check_inbox, check_sent, recall_message) or `romp mail`. Each tool's description carries its norms. Two to know up front:
- Message a peer only for something substantive (it wakes them and costs a turn); set `kind` to delegate, coordinate, or question, and put the whole point in the first sentence.
- BEFORE editing shared files, run list_agents and check peers' branches + working-notes to avoid collisions (overlap only collides on the same branch); publish yours with set_working.
For the full guide (shell CLI, remote-machine tunnel setup, coordination detail), invoke the romp-postal skill.
