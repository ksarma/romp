"""The nudge's FIRE-TIME FRESHNESS GUARD + verdict instrumentation (the user 2026-08-25, the
completion-vs-nudge collision): a due nudge and a completion report meet at the end of every long
autonomous run — the redundancy judge deliberates over a snapshot of the transcript tail, and a
report landing DURING that deliberation was invisible (the verified specimen: report 11:18:14, the
session stopped its own loop 11:18:32, the nudge fired 11:18:33 asking where the work stood). The
guard is the writer-yields family at the fire moment: the transcript's newest assistant timestamp
moving past the snapshot's IS the world outrunning the evidence — hold, re-judge ONCE against the
fresh report (never a loop), fire only what survives. Every gate decision is now a nudge-events row
(fired / skipped-redundant / held-fresh-re-judged / fired-at-cap / skipped-redundant-at-cap /
skipped-redundant-memo / resolved-at-send / blocked-on-user-at-send, each carrying the evidence
timestamp), so redundant
fires are countable from the log alone. That accounting is what re-shaped the cap (the user
2026-08-27, T120): the blind third fire measured at 56% of deliveries, re-asking answered
questions — the cap now ESCALATES to one more judgment on the freshest evidence, never past it.
And the send moment re-reads the store: an item the fresh rollup no longer calls working leaves
the card (resolved-at-send / blocked-on-user-at-send) — the redundancy judge deliberates for
seconds, and verdicts land in that gap. SYNTHETIC fixtures only."""
