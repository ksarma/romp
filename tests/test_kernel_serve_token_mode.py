"""The serve-token file is the same-user gate on the whole kernel, and every client holds a COPY of
it (bin/romp and the hooks read the file, the bus and each session's MCP process load it at start,
peers fetch it at attach). So `_load_token` has two jobs beyond returning a string: the file must be
0600 from its first byte, and an EXISTING token must never be replaced behind those clients' backs.

The old loader failed the second job in three ways, each pinned here by a case that fails on it:
  - ANY read fault fell through to the mint (`except OSError: pass`), so an EACCES or EIO rotated
    the token: the kernel came up with a credential nobody else held. UnreadableIsNotRotated.
  - Two starters (kernel and bus boot together) each minted their own, last writer winning while
    the loser served a token the file no longer held. ServeTokenFlock.
  - The mint opened the LIVE path with O_TRUNC, so a concurrent reader saw an empty file and
    minted its own. TokenBirth pins the temp-then-rename shape and that the live path is never
    opened for writing at all.
TightenMode (a loose existing file is chmod'd, its value kept), EmptyFileMints (a 0-byte or
whitespace file is a torn earlier mint and is minted over, aloud), LockFailureIsFailClosed (no
lock: a good 0600 token is returned, anything else is a refusal) and StaleTempsAreSwept (a crashed
attempt's temp, any pid's, is removed before the mint) pin the rest of the contract. From review
(2026-09-08): CheckinCarriesServedToken (the handshake announces TOKEN and never touches the file),
TempIsExclusive (O_EXCL is behaviour, not source text: a file already at the temp path is never
written over), SymlinkIsRefused (a link at the token path is a fault, its target untouched),
LockWaitIsAnnounced (a starter blocked by another holder says so before waiting), ImportRefusalIsLoud
(a read fault at import exits the kernel non-zero with the file untouched, in a subprocess), and the
tighter-mode cases in TightenMode and LockFailureIsFailClosed (0400 is left alone; only bits outside
0600 go).
ServeTokenLoadersMatch pins the bus's copy of the routine to the kernel's, since the bus imports
nothing from kernel/ and carries its own: AST identity with the docstring stripped (any divergence
is red), plus the named invariants as a readable second layer.

ServeTokenFileMode is the original mode case. It INTERPOSES on os.chmod because the old shape's
trailing chmod repaired the mode before anything could observe it; the shape now needs no chmod on
a fresh mint at all, and that is what the case asserts.

Synthetic only: hermetic temp STATE, placeholder tokens.
