"""TABS-FIRST (the user 2026-06-26): the tabOrder push carries name+color per tab so the client can paint the
WHOLE strip as placeholders up front (no one-by-one pop-in). Every strip sender (_push, on its cycle and as
the connect push a `ready` triggers; _push_session_now; _confirm_close_now) hands a `tabs` list of {id, name,
color} alongside the sid `order` to _send_tab_order, the one frame builder's caller. The `ready` handler
sends no strip of its own, whichever app's renderer posted it.
On the fork each sender hands the builder the liveness map its own _tab_list_tmux collapse guard affirmed for
the cycle (never a raw _tmux_sessions() read), and the frame carries the `live` sids that map affirms (T258: the
pane keeps a live sid the order omits).
