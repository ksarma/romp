"""Connection-status reporting (the user 2026-06-27): a real network drop used to blind-reload each pane
iframe into a dead page, so the dashboard silently froze (the timeline "stopped moving") with no explanation.
Now each pane reports its WebSocket state to the shell, and the panes RECONNECT (retry) instead of
blind-reloading — reloading to resync only once the socket is actually back.

The shell surface changed on 2026-07-27: the fixed top "Disconnected — reconnecting…" banner is gone —
connection drops now log entries in the shell's NOTIFICATION CENTER (the bell in the bottom bar, red while
anything is unread or a visible pane is down), whose behavioral tests live in test_error_center.py. The
source pins here cover the pane shim (unchanged) and the shell's wiring of the center."""
