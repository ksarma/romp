"""T406 (the user 2026-09-13): the chat rail's time markers for TODAY read how long ago, in the user's words ("now",
"1 min ago", "N min ago", "1 hour ago", "N hours ago"), the exact HH:MM riding each stamp's tooltip; any other
day keeps the clock time exactly as before, its day divider naming the day. Proven on the real /chat page of a hermetic
kernel with the browser's clock INSTALLED (Playwright's fake clock, started at the epoch the fixture was stamped from and
flowing), two synthetic sessions: `web`, two rows yesterday then six today, spaced so every word of the vocabulary shows
("2 hours ago", "1 hour ago", "59 min ago", "5 min ago", "1 min ago", "now"); `api`, four rows all yesterday. Asserted in both
themes: every today stamp reads the label the vocabulary gives for its calendar-minute distance from the page's own clock,
the plural-hours form with "ago" on a line of its own, stamped only where the label CHANGES from the previous timed row's
(the rail's same-minute rule at the label's grain), its title the row's HH:MM; every other-day marker is the HH:MM with no
class and no title; no label overflows the 56px slot (the marker's scrollWidth is its clientWidth) or reaches the dot;
two-line stamps never overlap the next stamp; and the vocabulary's widest forms are measured in the marker's own font per
theme at the default 13px chat font and at 14px, for the record the user asked for (the one-line forms fit the slot at
13px; at 14px the two-digit minute forms are wider than the slot and pre-line wraps them at their space, so nothing ever
overhangs toward the dot). Across the tick a marker whose label did not change is not touched at all (no mutation
records; a selection inside its stamp survives, where a replaced text node would collapse it): the painter writes only
what differs. A reading counts only while the probed turn is still attached: the transcript can be rebuilt under the
probe by a path outside the rail (a kernel push, the page's retry scheduler answering for the lab's blocked session),
which collapses the selection and leaves the observers on detached nodes; each minute is taken in two jumps, to just
before the boundary (where the page's own clock-keyed work fires) and, after a real-time settle that flushes queued
frames, the few hundred milliseconds that contain the tick alone; an inconclusive reading re-arms on the fresh nodes and
takes the next minute, up to six times (RT_INJECT_REBUILD=1 rebuilds the probed turn on purpose, so that path is
executed). Then the page's clock is
paused and jumped past the next clock-minute boundary: the rail's ONE minute timer fires, the labels move by a minute (the
row "now" reads "1 min ago"; the row at 59 minutes reads "1 hour ago", the same as the row before it, so its stamp goes
quiet), the yesterday markers do
not change, and every turn's box (top, height, left, width) is exactly where it was: the transcript did not move. The
sticky stamp over a today turn scrolled past the top line wears the same two-line label. With RT_SHOTS=<dir> the driver
writes screenshots: the today run (`web`) and the yesterday run (`api`), dark and light. Skips LOUDLY without the extension
deps or a Playwright browser; the extension CI job installs Chromium and runs served files with ROMP_SERVED_TESTS_REQUIRE=1,
which turns any skip into a failure there. SYNTHETIC fixtures only (sessions web and api, the notes-api demo world)."""
