"""T215: a kernel restart between an attachment's ship and its ack must not wedge the upload.

The wedge (verified on main before the fix): file bytes ride the ws as base64 dropFile and
complete on a droppedPath ack sent back on the SAME socket. pendingShips is in-memory and
nothing on romp:wsup ever re-shipped or failed it — so a kernel restart in the ship→ack window
left the chip pulsing forever, and a send held by the ship gate ("Wait for the upload") waited
on an ack that could no longer arrive: message plus attachment parked with no error.

The fix, both faces:
  * same-page reconnect (the served dashboard): every pending entry retains its encoded payload
    and re-ships on romp:wsup — the exact kernel-is-back event, never a timer. The ack/nack
    echoes the client's shipId, so a duplicate ack from a re-ship race retires exactly the chip
    that asked, and a stray twin is DROPPED instead of attached to the active tab. Since the fold
    that brought the reload core (T265: a kernel-served page reloads itself when the kernel serving
    it restarts), the chat pane also holds that reload while any ship awaits its ack or a send is
    held behind the ship gate (T272: render.ts wraps the shim's window.__rompPaneBusy and answers
    'upload' / 'held-send'; the core asks it before firing), and tells the core when the last ack
    lands or the gate clears (endReloadHoldIfIdle, __rompReload.ended()), so the heal runs first and
    the reload follows it on that event. Without the hold the reload landed about 1.7 s after the
    relaunch and took the payload with it. The notices raised when the LAST ship retires (a nack: the
    file was not saved, the held message not sent; the ack of a held send on another tab) would die
    with that reload, which follows in the next task, so the page keeps the toasts on screen in this
    tab's sessionStorage on the core's pre-reload hook, with the core's release note when its 60 s
    backstop fired, and the fresh page shows them again once (render.ts persistNoticesForReload,
    reload-notices.ts liveNotices / releasedNotices / keepReloadNotices / takeReloadNotices).
  * reload (the VS Code pipe reloads its webview on kernel reconnect): the payload dies with
    the page, so the ship NAMES persist beside the drafts and the next load says LOUDLY what
    was lost — never a silent vanish.

The guards here:
  * SourcePins — runs everywhere, CI included: the wiring above, pinned in the sources (the
    webview-side twins live in ui/webview/pending-attach.test.ts).
  * ServedWedge — the executed guard: boots the hermetic kernel, opens the real /chat page,
    SIGSTOPs the kernel so the dropFile is shipped on a live socket that will never answer,
    holds a send behind the ship gate, SIGKILLs and relaunches the kernel — and asserts the
    reconnect re-ships, the thumbnail lands, and the held send fires, and only THEN the page reloads
    itself onto the relaunched kernel's boot id, with no loss to announce. Plus the regression leg:
    a normal ship+send against the restarted kernel behaves exactly as before. Skips LOUDLY
    when the extension deps or a playwright browser are absent (CI installs no browsers).
  * NackNoticeSurvivesReload: the same wedge with the relaunched kernel unable to save the
    re-shipped file. Its nack retires the last pending ship, which lets the restart's held
    reload fire on the next task, and the notice the nack raised (the file was not saved, the
    held message not sent) must be shown again by the fresh page, once.

All fixtures synthetic.
