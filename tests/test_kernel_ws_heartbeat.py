"""WS heartbeat + client staleness watchdog (the user 2026-06-29). The pusher DEDUPS, so a quiet fleet sends
no view frames; a client whose socket goes SILENTLY half-open (TCP dead, no onclose) then receives nothing and
never recovers — the feed froze on stale cards (a 'blocked in picker' card that the session had long left)
until a manual reload. Fix: the kernel sends a tiny 'ka' keepalive to every client on a fixed cadence, and the
page shim stamps lastRecv on every frame + a watchdog force-reconnects (→ reload-resync) when it stops arriving.

Synthetic only — no real session data.
