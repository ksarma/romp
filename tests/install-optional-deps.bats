# pick_python's minor check for that X.Y only, the >= 3.10 gate, the version and tag prints and the
# ensurepip probe, and stands in for `python -m venv` by laying down a pip and a python that exit 0
# (the python's cat reads /dev/null, never the caller's stdin: romp-codex-setup runs it once with no
# heredoc, and a bats run from a terminal would otherwise hang there until that stdin closed), plus the
# tagged lib/python3.X{t} directory a real venv has, logging which python built which venv.

# ── the SDK is installed at the version the session host is written against ─────────────────────
# kernel/session_host.py imports the SDK's private internals (claude_agent_sdk._internal) with no fallback,
# and a release that moves one fails every hosted session launch. Until 2026-09-18 this script ran
# `pip install --upgrade claude-agent-sdk`, so a routine re-run could install that release with nothing to say
# so (the box admin's hazard review of the pull-in, 2026-09-16). The version is declared ONCE, as
# SDK_TESTED_VERSION in kernel/session_host.py; the script reads that line and pins pip to it. This test reads
# the line the same way and holds the pip call to it, so the two cannot drift apart unnoticed.
