"""build_feed is CACHE-ONLY on a cold start, and its background parse-warmer must NOT compete with the chat.

The feed's CARDS come from the goal store (cheap); the working-dots / deep-link anchors / API-error+awaiting
badges / provisional card read the transcript parse ONLY if it's already cached (_parse_cached), so the cards
paint at once on a cold kernel start (the user 2026-06-26). The dedicated warmer (_warm_fleet_bg) fills the
cache for a FEED-ONLY window — but a chat or timeline client already parses the same fleet into the same
cache, so the warmer must skip then, or it steals GIL from the chat's active-tab reshape on a cold restart.
The one exception to cache-only (2026-09-18): a session the memo already holds warm is re-read in place when its
files moved, so its entry never falls cold for a build; a session never parsed still costs the first paint nothing.
The re-read runs only while the transcript can be stat'ed (2026-09-21): a leaf gone from disk has no store slot to
re-read into, so that entry falls cold instead and asks the warmer for nothing. The warmer's own loop skips such a
leaf too (the post-merge review of that gate, 2026-09-21), so a warm another cold session kicked never parses it.
