"""Every kernel-restart notice romp injects has identical text, so the segment-id derivation (which hashes
the segment's trigger text) gave every restart-notice segment in a session the same hash, and the kernel's
timestamp-invariant lookup key (_seg_key = session id plus that hash) treated them all as ONE segment
(T318, 2026-09-10: a card whose recorded segments included one restart-notice segment resolved, through
that key, to whichever restart-notice segment the parse saw last, so its summary click landed on an
assistant turn hours after the work the summary described). A romp system notice (or an auto-nudge)
carries no user content and has no composer echo to drift against, so its segment is keyed by its anchor
atom's uuid, exactly as a text-less seam already is; so is every other segment a machine wrote the trigger of
(any romp injection: the retry message, an auto-nudge; the CLI's stop record; a scheduled task's fired prompt,
stamped by its origin or read from its preamble). Two cut turns, two identical
notices: distinct ids, distinct keys, and the card's anchors stay inside its own segments. SYNTHETIC fixtures
only: a private synthetic sid, invented text, placeholder uuids."""
