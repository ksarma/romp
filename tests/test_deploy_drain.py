"""The deploy-drain hold (T121 part 1, 2026-08-27): while a quiet deploy restart is PARKED at the
manager, the kernel holds NEW turn starts so /busy falls to 0 on its own turn-end events — before
this, kernels kept starting queued turns and a busy box only ever "drained" via the manager's
backstop cut. The hold is a LEASE (refreshed by the parked poll, self-expiring when the holder
dies) and RUNTIME-ONLY (a fresh boot starts clear by construction — the manager-approved
stale-flag guard); arming is visible once per episode and a long hold escalates to the problems
ring. Mid-turn forwards keep flowing so the in-flight turn can finish; queued prompts persist —
that IS the checkpoint. Hermetic state; synthetic sids only."""
