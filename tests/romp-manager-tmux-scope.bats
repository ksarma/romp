# bin/romp-manager's startTmuxServer, through a REAL manager start. On Linux with the switch on it runs
# `tmux start-server` through `systemd-run --scope` in a romp-tmux-<ms> unit, so the server sits outside
# the service cgroup and outlives a service restart; when systemd-run fails it says so and starts the
# server bare, saying that too. tmuxStartArgv, the pure argv choice, has its node suite
# (tests/manager-tmux-scope.test.js); this file covers the call itself, the fallback, and the log lines,
# which nothing else did — the other manager-driving suites run with the switch floored off.
#
# A FAKE systemd-run first on PATH records its argv, then either execs the command after `--` (what
# --scope mode does for real) or, with FAKE_SYSTEMD_RUN_FAIL set, exits 1 with a bus error on stderr. A
# recording fake tmux answers the command either way; with FAKE_TMUX_FAIL set it exits 1 with tmux's
# connect error on stderr, which is what tmux failing INSIDE a scope that did start looks like to the
# manager. Nothing here reaches the real systemd-run or the user manager: the switch is turned on only
# behind the fake, and the floor tmux_private_socket_dir sets (ROMP_CLI_SCOPE=0) stays for the case
# that pins it.
