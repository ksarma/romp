# .githooks/pre-push — the identifier scan, driven by hand against real commits.
#
# The hook refuses to publish a commit carrying a string from the machine's
# private-strings denylist. Every identifier below is SYNTHETIC (the repo may go
# public, and a real one written here would be the very leak the hook exists to
# stop): the denylist, the paths and the hostnames are all invented per test.
#
# The SYMLINK cases are the reason this file exists. `git grep` searches
# regular-file blobs only, so a symlink whose TARGET carries an identifier is
# invisible to it — a `node_modules -> /home/<user>/…` link created to run the
# extension tests in a worktree was swept up by `git add -A`, pushed to a public
# branch, and found by a human reviewer rather than by this hook (2026-08-13).
# A symlink's target IS its content once committed, so the hook reads those
# blobs directly and these tests hold that line.
#
# The two CONTENT rules, both about what a push changes on the remote: the TIP
# tree of each pushed ref must be clean (that is what a push exposes), and each
# commit no fetched remote already has must ADD no banned line: a commit that
# only inherits an older leak in its tree is not refused, a commit that
# introduced one is, even if a later commit removed it again. The hook's two
# METADATA rules (each new commit's author and committer addresses, and its
# message, with an annotated tag's own tagger and message under the same two)
# have their own files, pre-push-identity.bats and pre-push-message.bats.
# install-sh.bats exercises the hook through a real `git push`; this file feeds
# it ref lines directly, so it can model a remote and its remote-tracking refs
# the way a clone has them.
#
# The tip scan reads symlink TARGETS as well as regular files: git grep reads
# regular-file blobs only, and a committed link's target is its blob content, so
# a link pointing into a home directory is a leak the grep pass alone cannot see.
# The added-lines pass sees a NEW link the way it sees any added line.
#
# A read the hook cannot COMPLETE is not an empty result: a tip whose tree git
# grep could not scan, a tree whose listing failed, a link whose blob could not
# be read, a commit whose diff could not be read is refused as unscanned, the way
# a tag field the hook cannot read is (pre-push-identity.bats). The cases at the
# end hold that line, each with a git first on the hook's PATH that refuses one
# command shape.
