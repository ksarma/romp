# .githooks/pre-push — the identifier scan, driven by hand against real commits.
#
# The hook refuses to publish a commit carrying a string from the machine's
# private-strings denylist. Every identifier below is SYNTHETIC (the repo may go
# public, and a real one written here would be the very leak the hook exists to
# stop): the denylist, the paths and the hostnames are all invented per test.
#
# The SYMLINK cases are the reason this file exists. `git grep` searches
# regular-file blobs only, so a symlink whose TARGET carries an identifier is
# invisible to it — a `node_modules -> /home/<user>/…` link created to run the
# extension tests in a worktree was swept up by `git add -A`, pushed to a public
# branch, and found by a human reviewer rather than by this hook (2026-08-13).
# A symlink's target IS its content once committed, so the hook reads those
# blobs directly and these tests hold that line.
#
# The two CONTENT rules, both about what a push changes on the remote: the TIP
# tree of each pushed ref must be clean (that is what a push exposes), and each
# commit no fetched remote already has must ADD no banned line — a commit that
# only inherits an older leak in its tree is not refused, a commit that
# introduced one is, even if a later commit removed it again. The hook's two
# METADATA rules — each new commit's author and committer addresses, and its
# message, with an annotated tag's own tagger and message under the same two —
# have their own files, pre-push-identity.bats and pre-push-message.bats (added
# 2026-09-09, when an unset user.email stamped a hostname through both content
# scans). install-sh.bats exercises the hook through a real `git push`; this
# file feeds it ref lines directly, so it can model a remote and its
# remote-tracking refs the way a clone has them.
