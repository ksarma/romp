"""unittest-side twin of conftest.py's state floor (2026-08-12): `python -m unittest tests.test_x`
imports this package first, so the floor lands before any test module loads bin/romp-* — which
resolve their state root at import time. conftest.py covers only pytest; without this, a bare
unittest run operated on the REAL ~/.local/state/romp (tests/test_kernel.py overwrote the real
remotes.json that way today). Does NOT cover `cd tests && python -m unittest test_x` or a direct
script run — the per-module preambles do, and tests/test_state_isolation_order.py enforces them."""

# Temp-directory hygiene, the in-process half (2026-09-06): the suite used to leak every directory it
# made. This floor and conftest.py's each minted a state root per process and never removed it (nine
# per `pytest -n 8` run), and about three hundred test modules call tempfile.mkdtemp with no cleanup
# of their own. On a machine where many sessions run the suite all day that left about 1.4 million
# directories under /tmp, enough that listing /tmp took minutes and tens of gigabytes of memory, and
# the out-of-memory kills that followed took a live kernel down. The fix is at the source: every
# tempfile.mkdtemp call made in THIS process is recorded, and everything recorded is removed at
# interpreter exit (and, under pytest, at session end; see conftest.py). Only directories this
# process created, and only under the process temp dir, are ever removed: tempfile.gettempdir(),
# which is the system temp dir under a unittest run and conftest's private per-run root under
# pytest. tempfile.TemporaryDirectory goes through the same mkdtemp and cleans itself first, so the
# exit sweep finds nothing of it.
# What this hook cannot see is the other half, conftest.py's: directories made by CHILD processes
# (kernels, git, a shell's `mktemp -d`), files from mkstemp, and os.mkdir paths under the temp dir.
# Under pytest those land in conftest's root because TMPDIR points there, and the root is removed
# whole at run end; the two directories this process mints BEFORE that redirect (this package's
# state dir below, and the root itself, both recorded here but outside the redirected gettempdir()
# and so skipped by this sweep) are conftest's to remove. No such cover exists under a bare
# unittest run, where the per-module cleanups (addCleanup, tearDownClass) are what there is.
