"""unittest-side twin of conftest.py's state floor (2026-08-12): `python -m unittest tests.test_x`
imports this package first, so the floor lands before any test module loads bin/romp-* — which
resolve their state root at import time. conftest.py covers only pytest; without this, a bare
unittest run operated on the REAL ~/.local/state/romp (tests/test_kernel.py overwrote the real
remotes.json that way today). Does NOT cover `cd tests && python -m unittest test_x`, where the
per-module preambles are the floor (tests/test_state_isolation_order.py enforces them). A direct
`python3 tests/test_x.py` reaches this package through the module's own `from romp_load import
load_source` (tests/romp_load.py's bootstrap, 2026-09-14), so it has this floor from that import on;
the module's preamble stays its first line of defence and follows the import.
Since 2026-09-14 the run's private temp root, the TMPDIR redirect into it and the owner marker the
kernel's sweep reads live here too (below), for the same reason: they were conftest.py's, so a bare
run had none of them."""

# Temp-directory hygiene, the in-process half (2026-09-06): the suite used to leak every directory it
# made. This floor and conftest.py's each minted a state root per process and never removed it (two
# per pytest process: eighteen for a `pytest -n 8` run), and about three hundred test modules call
# tempfile.mkdtemp with no cleanup of their own. On a developer machine that ran the suite many times
# a day that left about 1.9 million directories under the system temp directory, enough that listing
# it took minutes and tens of gigabytes of memory, and the out-of-memory kills that followed took a
# running romp kernel down. The fix is at the source: every tempfile.mkdtemp call made in THIS
# process is recorded, and everything recorded is removed at interpreter exit (and, under pytest, at
# session end; see conftest.py). Only directories this process created, and only under the process
# temp dir, are ever removed: tempfile.gettempdir(), which is the private per-run root minted below
# under every entry point that imports this package. tempfile.TemporaryDirectory goes through the
# same mkdtemp and cleans itself first, so the exit sweep finds nothing of it.
# What this hook cannot see is the other half, the root's: directories made by CHILD processes
# (kernels, git, a shell's `mktemp -d`), files from mkstemp, and os.mkdir paths. Those land in the
# root because TMPDIR points there, and the root is removed whole at exit (and, under pytest, at
# run end by conftest.py, which names a survivor).

# The private temp root, the child-process half (2026-09-06, in conftest.py until 2026-09-14): every
# temp path a run creates lives under ONE `romp-tests-*` root, removed when the run ends. The hook
# above records and removes what THIS process mints through tempfile.mkdtemp, but a test's children
# — kernels, git, `mktemp -d` in a shell — and mkstemp or os.mkdir paths are outside its sight (a
# full run left ~5,600 of those per run at up to ten a second). So the process's temp dir is
# redirected: tempfile.tempdir is set directly (gettempdir() caches its first answer, and the line
# recording the system temp dir has just called it), and TMPDIR is exported so every child inherits
# the same root. Import-time, and in this package rather than conftest.py: the package is the first
# thing BOTH entry points import (pytest imports it before conftest.py; `python -m unittest
# tests.test_x` imports it before the module), so the root, the redirect and the marker below are in
# place for a bare run too. While these were conftest.py's, a bare run had no redirect and no marker:
# every child's `mktemp -d`, every mkstemp file and (once killed mid-run, with the hook's exit sweep
# never reached) every tracked directory and the romp-tests-state-* dir landed loose in the system
# temp dir, and with no marker the kernel's sweep had to refuse them, so a shared machine
# accumulated thousands of them from runs that were killed (2026-09-14).
# The root itself is minted with the REAL mkdtemp: it is not the hook's to remove (the hook's scope
# is the inside of the root), so it is not recorded. The state dir below is minted AFTER the redirect,
# through the hook, and so sits INSIDE the root; nothing a run makes sits outside it.
# Under pytest-xdist this runs in the controller and in every worker: each imported this package and
# so owns a root of its own (a worker's sits inside the controller's, since it inherits that TMPDIR).
# The system temp dir — the one the RUN was handed, before any redirect — is recorded once, by the
# first process to import this package: an xdist worker inherits the controller's record along with
# its TMPDIR (setdefault, not an assignment: a worker's own gettempdir() is the controller's root, and
# recording that put the worker's fallback one level deeper than a socket path can bear under a
# long TMPDIR — four socket tests failed at bind under -n 2). A test that must leave the root (an
# AF_UNIX socket path that would not fit sun_path under a nested root) falls back to it, and only
# to it — a literal system path in a `dir=` would bypass the redirect (one did).
