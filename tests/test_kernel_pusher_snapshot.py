"""The pusher cycle takes ONE liveness snapshot (the 2026-08-10 CPU fix).

Every _live_map() read asks both backends for their rows and sweeps the whole SDK reg registry.
The pusher's cycle used to take NINE of them — one inside _push plus one per tick job — at its
0.5s cadence, which profiling attributed as the kernel's single hottest thread (~50-90% of one
core sustained, three quarters of total process CPU). The jobs all take the map as a parameter
by design, so the fix is purely structural: one snapshot at cycle start, handed to everything.

SYNTHETIC fixtures only: placeholder UUIDs, invented names.
