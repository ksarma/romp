"""The judging band is built from the per-call LOG as RUN SPANS (the user 2026-06-19, g70): each judge
call plotted at its real wall-clock [sent, recv], glossed from the nearest artifact mark — so a judge that
RAN shows up WHEN it ran (distiller lag, coordinating-courier classifications) instead of back-placed onto
the work it summarizes. Self-contained: drives _run_judging with a synthetic judge-usage.jsonl.
