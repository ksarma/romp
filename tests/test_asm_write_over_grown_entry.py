"""T396 (2026-09-12): a continuously active session never got an assembly document while its kernel lived. The settle's
document write compared the reader entry's record offsets against the tree's records by count, and a live leaf grows between
the settle's parse and the write (the CLI appends while the settle runs), so every write met an entry one record longer than
its tree and skipped ("offsets"); at every boot the leaf was read whole by whichever reader came first (120 MB through the
interrupt tick's judge parse on the boot after the T384 follow-up). The write takes the entry's prefix under the tree's own
generation. Synthetic transcripts only (the golden builders)."""
