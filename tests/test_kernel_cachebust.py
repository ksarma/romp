"""Tests for the kernel's bundle cache-busting (the stale-client fix). The browser was running an old
cached feed.js across kernel restarts; the fix versions every bundle url with the build mtime and
serves HTML no-cache, so a reload always pulls fresh JS. We pin the page-builder + version helpers
(the HTTP layer isn't unit-tested in this repo — see test_kernel.py's header).
