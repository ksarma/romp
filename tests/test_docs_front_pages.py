"""The documentation's front pages stay readable by a person (the user rule, 2026-09-20;
CLAUDE.md "The documentation front pages").

docs/index.md, docs/install.md and docs/guide.md are what someone meets before they know
anything about romp. The user spent July making them short and human, and by September they
had grown back into reference prose: an 11,000-word guide, and an install page that spent a
screen on which interpreter the kernel picks before it gave the install command. The rule the
user set afterwards: a person's attention is the scarce thing, an agent doing the install can
find the detail elsewhere, so these three pages carry one short paragraph per feature and the
detail lives in docs/reference.md under a heading matching the feature's name.

This test is the mechanical half of that rule. It pins:
- a word budget per page, so a page cannot grow back into a reference;
- a paragraph budget, since a page can be short and still unreadable in slabs (code blocks,
  tables, admonitions and raw HTML are not prose and are not counted);
- the install command inside the first screen of the install page, before anything optional;
- one pointer from the guide to the reference, in its opening line, and no paragraph on any
  governed page ending on a link, so a paragraph states what a feature does instead of sending
  the reader off the page they are reading;
- process documents out of the site's top-level navigation (docs/pr-tiers.md is contributor
  process, reachable by path and by URL, not a section of the site).

Moving text OUT of these pages is always allowed; the caps only bound what stays. When a page
genuinely needs more room, raise the cap here in the same change that spends it, so the budget
is a decision someone made rather than a line that drifted.
