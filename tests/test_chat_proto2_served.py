"""T323 stage 4b (2026-09-11): the proto-2 chat wire over a real hermetic kernel. A first kernel parses a compacted
synthetic session whole and leaves its assembly document at exit; a second kernel boots from it. A proto-2 tab's
session frame is the post-boundary tail with headKnown false and headTotal null and hydrates nothing (the
flattening step: no pre-cut body is read at a first open); loadOlder by uuid walks page by page to the head, where
the count appears, and the pages plus the tail equal what an index (proto-1) client on the same kernel assembles
from today's frames; loadAround lands a deep anchor in one reply as a run by its span; loadTurns pages the gap to the
window back to the live tail and re-attaches, so the next transcript append reaches it as a chatTail; every leaf
byte is the tail, the guards and the pages asked for. Synthetic transcript (the stage 4a fixture); TESTHOST.

The restored-kernel case waits on the wire's own events where the fork's pusher cadence makes a read timing-bound (2026-09-16,
the same family as the settle waits in tests/test_history_regions_browser.py and tests/test_landing_notice_browser.py): the
pusher here holds PUSH_MIN_INTERVAL_S (1.0 s) between cycle starts (tests/test_pusher_cadence.py), so a proto-1 index client
whose page walk fits inside one cycle gap can leave before any cycle read the floor while it was connected, and the proto-2 tab
then never receives the floor-0 frame or the climb-back frame the case reads. The case waits for the floor-0 frame on the tab
before the index client leaves; the kernel is right either way (an unchanged list is an empty tail), the lab's read was early.
Red twice on CI at upstream's text, green on a box; the wait beside the read says how it was traced."""
