# tests/ — every suite in one place

Every bug fix or feature change lands with a test (repo rule). Five suites:

- **`test_*.py`** (pytest) — the Python pipeline: event model, judges, kernel,
  backends, postal. They load the sources by file path through the stable
  `bin/` names with `from romp_load import load_source` (`tests/romp_load.py`,
  which reaches `kernel/loadsource.py`) and isolate state with `XDG_STATE_HOME`.
  The older `SourceFileLoader(...).load_module()` form is deprecated, with
  removal documented for Python 3.15: `tools/loadsource-sweep.py` rewrites a
  module still written that way (idempotent; `--check` reports without writing),
  and `test_state_isolation_order.py` refuses the call by file and line, naming
  that command. Both read the AST, so the idiom inside a string handed to a
  child process is a hand edit; so is the `sys.path` line a module needs before
  `from romp_load import load_source` when another test executes it by file
  path from outside this directory (`smoke_codex_live.py` carries one). Name
  every module `test_<stem>.py`: pytest also collects `<stem>_test.py`, but
  unittest's discovery (`test*.py`), the state-isolation check and the fixture
  scan in `test_postal_marker_form.py` take the `test_` prefix only, and
  `test_state_isolation_order.py` pins that.
  Every browser-driven served lab (a module that serves the dashboard from a copy of
  the built bundles) takes that copy from `lab_dist.copy_dist` (`tests/lab_dist.py`):
  one esbuild run per checkout state under a file lock, so xdist workers never copy
  a build in flight; the state is keyed on the trees `esbuild.js`'s exported configs
  name (node requires the module, which builds only as a script; no text scan), the
  config's own tree, and their imports. A checkout whose environment cannot build
  (the extension's node_modules absent, or esbuild failing) skips the served labs
  with the reason; the harness's own failures raise. The two pins that compare the
  derivation against the real tree run without node_modules too, through
  `tests/lab_dist_stub.py` (a node preload that stands in for a bare package the
  config itself requires and node cannot find, on a checkout with no node_modules
  beside the config, a dependency of the build and not of the exported data; a
  node_modules that exists and lacks the package makes it throw, and a skip
  inside its block is a failure). `tests/test_lab_dist.py`
  refuses a module that builds or copies dist on its own.
  Golden transcript fixtures: `test_romp_events_golden.py` + `fixtures/`.
  Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q` (~20s; a stalled run is a hang, not slow).
  The `_HAVE_SDK`-gated classes in `test_sdk_backend.py` (OptionsAssembly, the
  runner and can_use_tool bridge suites) SKIP unless `claude_agent_sdk` imports,
  and a skip reads as green — to execute them, put romp's SDK venv on the path:
  `PYTHONPATH=~/.local/state/romp/sdkvenv/lib/python3.12/site-packages python3 -m
  pytest tests/test_sdk_backend.py -q` (the venv `bin/romp-sdk-setup` creates;
  match the python version to it).
  Under pytest-xdist (`python3 -m pytest tests/ -n 4`) two import-time effects of
  `tests/test_host_transport.py` decide what a red means. It puts that same SDK venv
  on `sys.path` at import (the kernel's own idiom), and every worker imports every
  collected module before it runs a test, so over the whole directory the SDK is
  importable in each worker from then on: the `_HAVE_SDK`-gated classes above RUN,
  and five of their cases (OptionsAssembly, FastModeReportedState, ApiRetryState
  twice, ReconnectReconcilesInflight) fail against the installed SDK exactly as
  under the `PYTHONPATH` recipe; the module alone, or beside one that leaves the path
  alone, skips them and reads green (diagnosed 2026-09-16). Its cases that build SDK
  options with a `can_use_tool` callback raise
  `claude_agent_sdk.types.CanUseToolShadowedWarning` (a `UserWarning` subclass); a
  worker ships the warning to the controller, whose venv cannot import the class, and
  xdist's `unserialize_warning_message` takes the run down with an INTERNALERROR.
  `conftest.py`'s `pytest_configure` ignores it by MESSAGE prefix
  (`ignore:can_use_tool will not be invoked:UserWarning`): pytest re-parses the
  entries at every application, and one naming a class it cannot import is dropped
  with a PytestConfigWarning (every worker until the venv path is inserted, the
  controller always, CI always); a module-level `warnings.filterwarnings` does not
  survive pytest's per-test `catch_warnings`. So `-p no:warnings` is no longer part of an
  `-n` run. One more import-time leak reaches the postal suite the same way:
  `tests/test_kernel_tunnels.py` sets `ROMP_POSTAL_PEERS=0` at module level and the
  postal service reads it per call, so `test_postal_via_dedupe.py`'s
  PeerRoutePrefersDirect resolve case answers an error instead of a relay in any run
  that collects both. A red in one of these under `-n` is judged by the module
  alone: `python3 -m pytest tests/<module>.py -q`.
- **`*.bats`** — the shell surfaces: `bin/romp`, the launch chain, hooks,
  postal CLI. Keep them GNU/BSD-portable (CI runs bats on ubuntu).
  Run: `bats tests/*.bats`.
  Any suite that starts the real manager or the launch chain floors
  `ROMP_CLI_SCOPE=0` in setup: under `ROMP_SUPERVISED` (set by the service's
  unit, and inherited by a tool shell under a self-hosted install) the kernel
  spawns session CLIs through `systemd-run --scope`, so such a suite would
  otherwise leave a transient scope on the developer's user manager. The
  floor is `load cli-scope-floor` and `cli_scope_floor` in setup()
  (`tests/cli-scope-floor.bash`; until 2026-09-11 it rode the retired
  terminal backend's socket-directory helper). pytest's floor is
  `conftest.py`; `test_cli_scope_floor.py` pins both halves of it on the
  source, since a test that reads the value cannot tell the floor from
  `test_cli_scope.py`'s own import-time set.
  `conftest.py` also unsets the four `ROMP_CLI_SCOPE_*` limit variables
  (`ROMP_CLI_SCOPE_MEMORY_MAX` and the others) and the kernel's
  `ROMP_CLI_SCOPE_OOM_POLICY_REJECTED` marker: the kernel hands them to every
  session's CLI and a tool shell inherits them, so a suite run from a session on
  a self-hosted install would otherwise see them at every backend construction
  and in every exact argv pin. The marker rides every launch (`1` or empty), so a
  self-hosted tool shell always carries it, unlike the limits, which need
  `service.env`.
  `conftest.py` and `__init__.py` set
  `ROMP_MANAGER_PORT`, `ROMP_KERNEL_PORT` and `ROMP_SERVE_PORT` to a dead port
  (never unset: to every reader an absent variable means the live default), so
  no test dials a live manager or kernel through an inherited value.
  Any suite that starts the real `bin/romp-manager` also gives it a state
  root of its own before its first `@test` (`unset ROMP_STATE_DIR` plus
  `export XDG_STATE_HOME="$TEST_DIR/state"`, or an exported
  `ROMP_STATE_DIR`), since the manager boots from its state root's
  `kernels.json` and reads the serve token there; `bats-state-isolation.bats`
  is the ratchet.
  Any test whose subject binds a loopback port picks it with `load
  free-port` + `free_port VAR...`, never a literal: a literal shared by two
  files collided within one run (`romp-manager-ensure.bats` once used
  `romp-manager-origin.bats`'s control port), and any literal collides when
  two checkouts run bats at once on one machine. The helper picks below
  the ephemeral range, so a transient source port cannot hold the pick.
- **node suites** — live beside their sources in `ui/webview/*.test.ts` and
  `vscode-extension/src/*.test.ts`, run with `npm test` from
  `vscode-extension/`. Many pin lines of `kernel/kernel.py` as strings — run
  BOTH this and pytest on every kernel change.
- **`manager-*.test.js`** — the node supervisor (`bin/romp-manager`): restart
  gating, the kernel registry, and the drain-poll handshake. Run:
  `node --test tests/manager-*.test.js`.
- **`ui-bench.test.mjs`** — the dashboard pane bench (`tools/ui-bench.mjs`):
  the classifier, synthesizer, temp-path guard, recording client, front
  server, Handler-subprocess isolation, in-page instrument, profile fold, and
  real headless replays of synthetic feed and timeline streams.
  Run `node --test tests/ui-bench.test.mjs` from the repo root after
  `cd vscode-extension && npm ci && npm run build`. The browser tests skip,
  saying why, when no Chromium, `python3` or dist is present;
  `ROMP_UI_BENCH_REQUIRE=1` (CI) turns that skip into a failure, and
  `ROMP_UI_BENCH_TIMING=1` (a quiet machine, never CI) also asserts the timing
  relations the replays otherwise report as diagnostics.

**Temp files and git are hermetic, suite-wide.** Two mechanisms, one per half,
both in `tests/__init__.py`, which every entry point imports first (pytest before
`conftest.py`, `python -m unittest tests.test_x` before the module; a direct
`python3 tests/test_x.py` gets it through the module's own `from romp_load
import load_source`: imported under its bare name by a `test_*.py` run as a
script, `tests/romp_load.py` puts the checkout on `sys.path` and imports the
package (since 2026-09-14), so that import goes above the state preamble in
every module, which `test_state_isolation_order.py` holds; only `cd tests &&
python -m unittest test_x` has neither). It wraps
`tempfile.mkdtemp` so every directory the test process mints is recorded and
removed when the run ends (under pytest at session end, under `python -m
unittest` at exit): the in-process half, covering the 300-odd module preambles
and the per-test `mkdtemp()` calls nobody cleans up. And it covers what that
hook cannot see — directories made by child processes (kernels, git, a shell's
`mktemp -d`), `mkstemp` files, `os.mkdir` paths — by pointing the process temp
dir (`tempfile.tempdir` and `TMPDIR`, so every child inherits it) at one private
`romp-tests-*` root under the system temp dir, removed whole when the run ends
(before both, a full run left ~5,600 entries in `/tmp` and over a million had
piled up; until 2026-09-14 the root was `conftest.py`'s, so a bare unittest run
had none, and one killed mid-run left everything it made loose; a direct run
imported no package at all, and one module's left 86 loose `tmp*` directories in
a fresh `TMPDIR`). `conftest.py`
keeps the pytest side of that removal, with a survivor named (below). A run that
dies before any removal (pytest-timeout's `os._exit`, a killed shell) leaves the
root standing, so the package also writes an owner marker,
`romp-tests-owner.json` naming the run's pid, into the root at mint time. The
kernel's boot reconcile (`sweep_dead_test_roots` in `kernel/sdk_backend.py`)
removes `romp-tests-*` roots under the system temp dir whose marker names a
dead pid, renaming each to `<name>.sweeping` before deleting it so a partial
delete leaves a tombstone the next boot finishes. A root without a marker (a
foreign directory, a pre-marker root) is never touched by the sweep.
`test_tempdir_hygiene.py`'s `BareRunLeavesNothing` runs a leaking module as a
child in each bare shape, `python -m unittest` and a direct script, finished and
killed, and counts what is left. Still
clean up what you create — `with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`,
`self.addCleanup(shutil.rmtree, ...)`, a `tearDownClass` for a class-level
fixture — so a fixture is gone when its test is, not at exit; bats suites use
`mktemp -d` in `setup` and `rm -rf` it in `teardown`, and stand in for any
subject that detaches work (a detached launcher probe once re-created four to
six test dirs per run by minting a serve-token after the teardown). Never give
a tempfile call a literal
directory as its `dir` — by keyword or position, composed (`f"/tmp/{x}"`,
`os.path.join("/tmp", x)`) or through a name bound to one — and never point
`mktemp` (`-p`, `--tmpdir`, a `TMPDIR=` prefix) at a path under `/tmp`: that
bypasses the redirect, and the hygiene test reads every test file for those
shapes. The tests that must leave the root — `tests/test_host_transport.py`'s
AF_UNIX socket paths, which would not fit `sun_path` under a nested root — fall
back to `ROMP_TESTS_SYSTEM_TMPDIR`, the system temp dir the package recorded
once per run before redirecting (an xdist worker inherits the controller's
record), and remove what they made with an `addCleanup` (a directory outside
the root is outside the exit sweep's scope, so nothing else removes it; nine
per run leaked before). A root that cannot be removed at run end (a child
still writing under it, a 000-mode directory a test left behind) is named on
stderr: `[tests] not removed at run end: <path>`, instead of the run ending
green over it. The same conftest gives git no global or system config
(`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`) and a synthetic identity through
`GIT_AUTHOR_*` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*`; bats suites that run git get the same from
`load git-hermetic` + `git_hermetic` in `setup`, with a global config file of
the floor's own in place of none. That floor also forbids background git work:
the five no-background keys of `tests/git_fixture.py` (below) ride the
environment as `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` pairs, inherited by every git a test, a script
under test or a hook runs, and sit in the floor's global file, which receive-pack
in a bare fixture remote reads (a push over a local path starts it without the
pairs); so no detached `git maintenance` writes into a fixture repo while its
teardown removes it. A fixture must not depend on the developer's git
configuration (CI has none), and the env identity outranks
`git config user.*` and `-c user.*` — a test that must pin a particular author
exports its own `GIT_AUTHOR_*` after the floor. `tests/test_tempdir_hygiene.py`
and `tests/git-hermetic.bats` pin all of it.

**A fixture that builds a throwaway git repository runs git through
`tests/git_fixture.py`** (`from git_fixture import git, init_repo,
forbid_background`, registered under the bare name like `romp_load`). Every
command it runs carries `-c` flags that forbid background work
(`maintenance.auto`, `maintenance.autoDetach`, `gc.auto`, `gc.autoDetach`,
`core.fsmonitor`), `init_repo` writes the same keys into the repo's own config,
and `forbid_background` does so for a clone or worktree the kernel will run git
against: `git commit`, fetch and merge spawn `git maintenance run --auto`,
which on recent git detaches from its parent and can still be writing into
`.git` while the fixture's `TemporaryDirectory` removes the repo (the CI flake
`Directory not empty: '.git'` from `rmtree`, 2026-09-10). A file keeps its own
thin runner (its identity, timeout and return shape) and delegates the body;
read-only git against the real checkout stays a plain `subprocess.run`.
`tests/test_git_fixture.py` pins the runner with git's own trace: a commit
through it, and a plain fetch in a `forbid_background` clone, spawn no
maintenance or gc child.

**A served-page class copies the built `vscode-extension/dist/` with
`lab_dist.copy_dist` (the locked shape the fork keeps, described above), never
`shutil.copytree` and never `tests.dist_copy.copy_dist` directly.** Under
`pytest -n` a sibling class's build renames or removes its staging files
(`.<name>.tmp-<pid>-<n>`, `stagingPath` in `esbuild.js`) between the listing
and the copy, and a plain copytree raises `shutil.Error` before the class's
first test; the copy skips that shape. `tests/test_dist_copy_staging.py` pins
the copy and refuses a raw copytree of dist in any test module, and
`tests/test_lab_dist.py` refuses a `dist_copy` caller outside its allowlist.

**No test report shows a process-environment value or a credential-shaped
token.** An assertion whose container is an environment mapping prints the
whole mapping when it fails (`assertNotIn("X", os.environ)` renders every
variable), and on a developer's machine that mapping can hold a live key. The
fix is to test membership and name the key; the report hook in
`tests/conftest.py` is the net for an assertion still written the other way.
It redacts two things from every report's text and captured-output sections,
whatever the outcome (so `-rA`/`-rP` output for passed tests too), and from
collection reports: a value present in the process environment that is 16
characters or longer becomes `[REDACTED-ENV-VALUE]`, whole, per
whitespace-separated chunk, and per piece left beside a cut pytest or
unittest made (`'<head>...<tail>'`, `[N chars]`) when that piece is a
substring of the value (values are noted at the moment they are written
into `os.environ`, so one set inside `mock.patch.dict` and gone before the
assertion is caught too; exempt, never when the name is credential-shaped,
are path-valued names such as `PWD`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR` and the interpreter
paths GitHub Actions exports, the names whose values are public, the ones
GitHub Actions describes a run in (`GITHUB_REF`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`,
`GITHUB_ACTOR` and the rest) and the conftest's own synthetic git identity,
the `XDG_*` and `PYTEST_*` families, and any value that is an absolute path
this machine has), and a credential-shaped token becomes
`[REDACTED-CREDENTIAL]` wherever it came from, by the patterns in
`tests/credential_patterns.py` (public key prefixes, a JWT by its shape, a
long token where a value sits, pytest's own renderings of a failed comparison
included; a named git sha and a dated Anthropic model id are left alone). A
report the hook changes is rebuilt from the scrubbed text with
its crash location kept, so the short test summary still ends in the
assertion message; that report loses pytest's colour and source highlighting.
One it leaves alone keeps pytest's own rendering.
`tests/test_env_value_redaction.py` pins the rule, the write-time capture,
the patterns, the scrub's cost and the hook end to end.

**A lab kernel's environment is built from a list of names, and the file a
relaunch reads from carries a shorter list.** Every module that boots a hermetic
kernel (`bin/romp-kernel` under a lab's own `XDG_STATE_HOME`,
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `ROMP_DIST_DIR`, at a free port with a synthetic serve
token) builds its environment with `kernel_env` in `tests/test_ship_reship_served.py`,
never from a copy of the runner's. A run from a shell on a machine running romp
carries the live kernel's exports, and a lab kernel that inherited them exited
when the live manager restarted (`ROMP_MANAGER_PID`, the kernel's parent-death
watchdog), bound where the live kernel serves (`ROMP_SERVE_HOST`) and dialled
the machine's postal bus, or started one that nothing stops. From the runner
`kernel_env` takes `PATH`, `HOME`, the `XDG_*` names and, of the floor
the suite sets for the run's children (`TMPDIR` the tests package's since
2026-09-14, the rest `tests/conftest.py`'s), `TMPDIR`,
`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`, `ROMP_SERVICE_ENV_FILE`,
`ROMP_SERVICE_ENV`, `ROMP_CLAUDE_BIN` and `ROMP_CLI_SCOPE`; over those go the
lab's roots and seams, any seam the lab adds by keyword, and a postal bus of its
own that is never started (`ROMP_POSTAL_PORT` at a free port,
`ROMP_POSTAL_PEERS=0`, `ROMP_POSTAL_CLIENT_ONLY=1`). The served labs whose
driver kills and relaunches the kernel (`test_ship_reship_served.py`,
`test_dashboard_reload_served.py`) write the relaunch's command, environment and
log to the lab's `cfg.json` through `relaunch_cfg`, and the environment in that
file is narrowed once more by `relaunch_env`: the `ROMP_*` and `XDG_*` names,
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`,
`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` and `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`, less the `ROMP_TESTS_*` names,
which the tests package (conftest until 2026-09-14) exports for the run's own tests (such as
`ROMP_TESTS_SYSTEM_TMPDIR` above) and no kernel reads. Nothing else a lab put in
its kernel's environment reaches the file; each served lab plants a probe name
in that environment and checks the written file for its absence. To give a lab
kernel another name of the runner's, add the name to the list with its reason
beside it. `LabKernelEnv` and `RelaunchEnv` in `tests/test_ship_reship_served.py` pin
both functions; the served legs check the file itself.

`fixtures/` must stay SYNTHETIC: invented prompts, placeholder UUIDs, hostname
`TESTHOST` — never real session data.
