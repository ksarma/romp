"""The producer loop's scheduling policy (the user 2026-06-19): the TRIAGE tier runs ALWAYS for any live
session — no browser-connected gate — exactly like the INDEX tier, and the backstop between event-pokes is
short (3s). Source-level pins: the loop is an infinite thread that drives the real fleet, so its policy is
asserted against the source rather than executed. (Behaviour: each judge still only makes an LLM call when
it has real new work, so an idle pass is filesystem stats, not model calls.)
