"""The suite's backend-singleton ratchet (tests/conftest.py: _sdk_singleton_restored and the class- and module-scoped
_sdk_singleton_class_boundary and _sdk_singleton_module_boundary), tested by running pytest in a child over scratch
modules that load the real kernel under this checkout's conftest, the way tests/test_tempdir_hygiene.py's
RunLeavesNothing tests the temp-root floors: each scratch case takes one of the roads the suite takes to
km._sdk_backend, and the outer test reads what the ratchet said about it.

The defect the ratchet guards (2026-09-19): kernel.py builds its SdkBackend lazily, the first km._sdk() call
constructing it over jd.STATE as it stands and caching it in km._sdk_backend for the life of the process.
tests/test_kernel.py::ViewBuilder pointed jd.STATE at a sandbox, its card builds reached km._sdk() and built the
singleton over the sandbox, and its tearDown restored jd.STATE and removed the directory without touching the
singleton; a later module's chat signature consulted that backend, whose fork_children statted the removed
registry, answered {} on the OSError and scanned no registry, so a derivation counting registry stats read 0
against 39 in a test that did nothing wrong, and only under an order that ran ViewBuilder first.

The ratchet judges TRANSITIONS, at three windows. The test: the singleton read before the test and after its own
teardown, and the test whose own transition made the bad state fails (a different object left, or the directory
removed under the object it found). The class and module boundaries: a read at the scope's start and at its end,
after tearDownClass or tearDownModule, and the scope whose setup or teardown made the bad state fails, the error
landing on the scope's last test with the boundary named. The setup before a test: a singleton found over a gone
directory that no verdict has named yet was made by something outside every window (import-time code) and is
reported once per worker, at the first test that meets it, worded as inherited; every later test that inherits
the same object is quiet. Its one allowance is derived from the transition, never from a list of test names:
None before and a backend over jd.STATE with that directory present after is a worker's lazy first build under
the run root, the kernel's own design. WHICH test builds first depends on the run (the xdist scheduler, the
subset, the module order), so a name list could never be right: the census that found ViewBuilder saw a
different first builder on each of three workers. A kernel re-execution inside a test replaces the marker
function and resets the singleton, so the before value is stale and only what the test LEFT is judged, against
jd.STATE as the reload re-bound it: None or False pass, the lazy build over the loader's root passes, and a build
anywhere else is named with the re-execution wording; the kernel's FIRST load inside a test (no marker before) is
the same road, never an exemption.

The scratch modules, one nested run each, the cases in method order (unittest runs a class's methods
alphabetically, and each case's `before` is what the previous case left):
  A, the singleton built under the run root first:
    a. the worker's lazy first build (None before; after, a backend over jd.STATE, present) passes;
    b. ViewBuilder's fixed shape (save km._sdk_backend, sandbox jd.STATE, build, put both back, remove the
       sandbox) passes;
    c. a kernel re-execution inside the test, the singleton reset and rebuilt over jd.STATE, is not judged;
    d. a rebuild over the SAME root left in place fails: another object under an equal state_dir;
    e. ViewBuilder's original leak with the sandbox kept fails, naming the change and no gone directory;
    f. removing the directory under the singleton e left (the same object, present before and gone after) fails
       as this test's own transition, with the gone clause;
    g. ViewBuilder's original leak with the sandbox removed fails, naming the change, the gone directory and the
       remedy (its before value, f's gone object, was already named, so g starts quietly);
    h. a test that does nothing under g's gone object passes: inherited, already named, not accused.
  B, the leak as the worker's first build, and the re-execution road:
    a. None before and, after, a backend over a removed sandbox: the allowance does not cover it;
    b. a kernel re-execution that then builds over a removed sandbox fails with the re-execution wording and the
       gone clause;
    c. a kernel re-execution that then builds over a KEPT sandbox, jd.STATE restored, fails with the re-execution
       wording and no gone clause (the road the first form of the fixture exempted);
    d. XDG_STATE_HOME moved to a fresh root (hosts off), a re-execution so the judge re-binds jd.STATE there, then
       the lazy build over that root passes: the reference on this road is jd.STATE after the test (last in B,
       since it moves the child's environment).
  C, the first build over a sandbox that stands:
    a. None before and, after, a backend over a kept sandbox, jd.STATE elsewhere: the allowance does not
       cover it either (it asks for jd.STATE, not for any directory that exists).
  D, a class teardown that removes the directory under the singleton its tests left:
    One.a builds over a kept sandbox stored on the class and fails as its own; One.b does nothing and passes at
    its own window; tearDownClass removes the sandbox and writes a regular FILE at the path, and the class
    boundary fails at One.b's teardown with the gone clause (a file is not a directory); Two.a and Two.b do
    nothing under the named object and pass.
  E, an import-time leak (the module builds over a sandbox after loading the kernel, restores jd.STATE and
    removes the sandbox, before any test runs):
    a. does nothing and is the first test to meet the state: an ERROR at setup, worded as inherited, with no remedy
       addressed to it; b. does nothing and passes; c. makes a kept-sandbox leak of its own and fails as its own.
  K, a class that moves jd.STATE for its tests:
    One: setUpClass moves jd.STATE to a class sandbox; a's lazy build lands over it and passes at its own window
    (it inherited that root); b passes; tearDownClass restores jd.STATE and keeps the sandbox, and the class
    boundary fails at One.b's teardown as the author. Two: setUpClass saves the singleton and jd.STATE, resets
    the singleton and moves jd.STATE to its sandbox; a builds and passes; tearDownClass puts both back and
    removes its sandbox: quiet.
  L, a module teardown that removes the directory under the singleton its tests left:
    a builds over a kept sandbox stored on the module and fails as its own; b passes; tearDownModule removes it
    and the module boundary fails at b's teardown with the module named; the class end is quiet on the named
    object.
  H and H2, over a head that loads NO kernel at import (the worker's first load happens inside the test):
    H.a loads the kernel, then builds over a kept sandbox and fails with the first-load wording; H2.a loads the
    kernel, then makes the lazy build over the loader's root and passes (the run exits 0).

Mutations of the fixture run against this module, each landed and reverted (2026-09-19): the same-object gone
transition deleted (A.f passes silently); the gone check made absolute again (A.h, E.b and D.Two fail as false
accusations and every error count rises); the inherited report deleted (E.a passes: an import-time leak is never
reported); the named list dropped from the inherited report (E.b errors too); the class-scoped end judgment
deleted (D.One.b and K.One.b show no boundary error); the module-scoped end judgment deleted (L.b shows none);
the boundary comparing its end only to the last read (K.One passes silently); the boundary's restore exemption
dropped (K.Two errors); os.path.isdir replaced by os.path.exists (D.One's boundary verdict disappears: a file at
the path exists); the named skip at the boundary dropped (a second report at the class or module end of A, B, C, D, E, K
and L; where the scope's last case fails on its own, the boundary failure folds into that item's one teardown
report, so those runs pin it by reading the boundary text, not the count); the old re-execution exemption restored,
only the gone check surviving a changed marker (B.c and H.a pass silently); the marker ignored, every test on the
same-marker road (A.c fails falsely on the stale pre-reload object); a None marker before treated as the same-marker
road (H2.a fails falsely once the reference is the before read) or as an exemption (H.a passes); the changed road
compared to jd.STATE before the test (B.d fails falsely); the gone clause dropped from the re-execution wording
(B.b's clause assertion).
