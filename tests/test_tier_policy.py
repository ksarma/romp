"""The PR tier POLICY as a pure function over synthetic PR fixtures: scripts/ci/tier_policy.py, the
repository owner's rules of 2026-09-08, by tier and by the AUTHOR's role. The workflow only fetches data
and calls it; every rule here is pinned on fixtures so the gate's meaning lives in tests, not in a YAML step.

Roles are read from the author's collaborator permission in the record's permissions map: admin is the
repository owner, write or maintain a member, anyone else (including an author the map lacks, as a fork
PR's author is) a contributor. Members and contributors are gated alike; admin is the role that changes a
gate.

Tiers: docs and fix are ONE tier under two labels (tests-only is the pre-rename spelling of docs) and merge
on green for every author: the check requires no approval. feature merges on green when the author is an
admin (the owner's features merge straight away); by anyone else it needs an APPROVED review by an admin
other than the author on the current head (the owner looks first). major-feature needs, for every author,
a linked issue that someone other than the author has commented on (the opener alone does not count); a
non-admin author additionally needs that admin approval. Any PR touching .github/ or scripts/ci/, the
gate's own workflow and code, needs an admin's approval regardless of tier when the author is not an admin
(the base-branch check cannot stop a PR-branch job from posting a same-named success on pull_request
events, and nobody but the owner may rewrite the policy through a PR the check cannot see); an admin author
is exempt. A standing CHANGES_REQUESTED by a maintainer (write, maintain or admin) other than the author
holds a PR of any tier until that reviewer lifts it. No tier has a time-based path: the record carries no
time field and nothing in the policy reads one. Zero or two tier labels fail here too (belt and braces
with the label check). An approval is a reviewer's STANDING, their latest APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUESTED /
DISMISSED review (comment-only reviews never change standing; a dismissed approval never counts, whoever
dismissed it; a dismissed objection clears only when the reviewer dismissed it THEMSELVES, so the author
cannot dismiss the peer's objection away), by an admin other than the author, APPROVED, on the CURRENT
head. A renamed file counts under both paths; a file listing the API truncated makes the unseen files
guarded.
