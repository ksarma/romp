"""Every test module that loads romp code must make its state root hermetic FIRST (2026-08-12).

bin/romp-kernel, bin/romp-judge, bin/romp-event-model, bin/romp-postal-service and the modules
they pull in resolve STATE = ROMP_STATE_DIR || XDG_STATE_HOME/romp || ~/.local/state/romp at
IMPORT time (and romp-judge mkdirs it). tests/conftest.py points XDG_STATE_HOME at a temp dir,
but conftest is pytest-only: under `python -m unittest` (or a direct `./tests/test_x.py` run)
nothing sets the floor, and the module operates on the REAL ~/.local/state/romp. On 2026-08-12
exactly that happened: a unittest run of tests/test_kernel.py persisted its synthetic check-in
fixtures (TESTHOST, hubhost) into the real remotes.json / remotes-known.json — dropping a real
attached host's row — and the live kernel re-read the file at its next restart and began
ssh-dialing the fixtures. tests/__init__.py now gives unittest package runs the same floor
conftest gives pytest, but neither covers `cd tests && python -m unittest test_x` or a direct
script run, so the per-module preamble is the primary defence and this test is the ratchet.

The rule this file enforces, per tests/test_*.py module: if the module loads romp code (any
load_source or SourceFileLoader call, or an import of the kernel/postal/cli packages), then BEFORE
the first such load, at module top level, it must (a) assign os.environ["XDG_STATE_HOME"] (or
["ROMP_STATE_DIR"]) and (b) handle ROMP_STATE_DIR (assign it, or pop it — a live kernel exports
it to its sessions, and it outranks the XDG floor). The canonical preamble:

    # Hermetic state BEFORE the loads — they resolve their state root at import time, and only
    # pytest runs conftest's floor (a bare unittest or script run otherwise writes REAL state).
    os.environ["XDG_STATE_HOME"] = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    os.environ.pop("ROMP_STATE_DIR", None)  # a live kernel's export outranks the XDG floor

Static AST scan, ordered by line number; every in-process load call counts as state-touching —
load_source (tests/romp_load.py), SourceFileLoader and the importlib idioms
(spec_from_file_location/exec_module/import_module/__import__) alike, since most bin/* files are or
transitively load a STATE-resolving module, and
the few that aren't pay two harmless lines rather than this test resolving targets. Out of scope by design: a subprocess
spawned with a hand-built env= dict that carries the real HOME — env construction is dynamic and
defeats static checking; the preamble covers the common case because a child spawned without
env= inherits the mutated os.environ.

Two more rules over the same directory live in this module, because they read the same file list.
Every module loads through load_source: `SourceFileLoader(...).load_module()` warns on Python 3.10
and later with removal documented for 3.15, tools/loadsource-sweep.py rewrites a module still
written that way, and test_no_test_module_uses_the_removed_loader refuses the idiom by file and
line, naming that command. Every pytest module is named test_<stem>.py, never <stem>_test.py:
pytest's default collection takes both spellings, but unittest's discovery (test*.py), the
state-isolation check above and tests/test_postal_marker_form.py's fixture scan take the test_
prefix only, so a module under the other name would run with none of the three reading it.
