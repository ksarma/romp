"""Two bugs in how a remote row reports itself (the user 2026-07-28).

ONE — remembered values were served as live. kernelSha (and everything derived from it: outOfDate,
behindBy, aheadBy) plus the peer's declared mail tier are answers from the LAST SUCCESSFUL poll; the
supervisor only polls a row that is `up`. _remote_public() shipped them regardless of status, so a host
that had been unreachable for hours still reported a commit count and a mail tier beside its own
"disconnected" label — three claims, two unknowable. The values still ship (a blank row is less useful)
but now carry `stale` + `lastOk` so the UI can mark them.

TWO — recoveries never reached disk. _remotes_save() was called only from the ACT routes (attach, detach,
set_trust, checkin), never from the supervisor. So status/fails/gave_up/kernel_sha/detail lived in memory
alone: a row that failed, got persisted mid-failure by some unrelated act, then recovered left the file
frozen on the failure. Observed live — hours after a tunnel was healthily up, remotes.json still read
`starting` with a superseded sha and a by-then-unreachable hostname parked in `detail`.

The periodic save must ALSO not churn: the file is 0600 because every row holds that host's serve token,
and rewriting a credential file every 15s forever is its own defect. Hence the signature gate, which
deliberately ignores last_ok (restamped every pass a host answers).

Synthetic only — placeholder host/token, no network.
