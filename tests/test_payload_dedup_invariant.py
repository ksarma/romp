"""No pane payload may defeat _send_client's dedup by ticking with the clock.

test_chat_payload_clock_invariant.py asserts this for the CHAT payload, where the bug was first
found (a `firstSeen` that fell back to `now`). It came straight back on the FEED, which carries the
host clock as a deliberate top-level field: `now` (the client's hostNow, for age math) plus
`buildId` (sequences optimistic move acks). Both tick on every build, and _send_client compared the
whole serialization, so no feed payload ever matched the previous one and the kernel re-sent the
entire view to every client forever.

Measured on the wire before the fix (the user 2026-07-28, whose dashboard kept dropping the live
connection): app=feed shipped ~46 KB every ~2s on a fleet that wasn't changing — 12 of 12
consecutive frames byte-distinct, differing ONLY in `now` and `buildId`.

So the invariant here is one level up from the chat file's: a payload MAY carry the clock, but
everything the dedup actually compares must be clock-invariant. Any future field that ticks — an age
folded into a card, a "seconds since" counter — fails here instead of becoming another silent
firehose.

Synthetic only: placeholder uuid, invented prompt text, temp dirs.
