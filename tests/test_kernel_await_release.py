"""A peer's reply lifts the awaiting stamp again — for handoffs, not just questions (2026-08-18).

The 2026-08-15 change that stopped DELEGATES from making chip edges (ownership transferred is not a
dependency) also emptied last_ask of them — which silently removed _peer_answered_at's release, so a
delegated peer's reply no longer superseded a judge kind=peer stamp: the audit found a cross-host
handoff answered in 23 minutes still wearing Awaiting six hours later, with the 6h wake as the only
exit. The release reads every reply-REQUIRING outbound (question or delegate: last_await, 2026-09-08 —
it walked last_any first, until a coordinate the asker sent after the answer re-opened the pair),
restoring the designed exact ending event for questions and handoffs alike, while the chip edge stays
question-only exactly as intended.

Also pinned: an UNRESOLVABLE cross-host ask (the peer never sent a row, so the alias map cannot know
its sid) keys on the NAMED recipient — two asks to different sessions on one detached host used to
collapse onto the single (from, relay) pair, the later silently overwriting the earlier (a
29.6h-invisible ask found eaten this way). Synthetic rows only (placeholder ids, TESTHOST).

Since 2026-09-08 (mail keyed by the recipient's stable id): a relay row's own `to_sid` keys it exactly,
and the name→sid alias older rows fall back to is anchored at each row's SEND time (jd._alias_at), so a
name a NEW session reused no longer re-keys every OLD message to the new sid."""
