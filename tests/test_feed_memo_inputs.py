"""The feed memo's input census (T368).

build_feed serves each living session's cards from _feed_memo while _feed_session_key(s, ...) is unchanged, so the
key must contain every input _feed_session_entry reads that can change the entry. This module is the census that
argument rests on, in the shape of tests/test_chat_build_sig_inputs.py: HELPERS classifies every callee the body
reads from module scope (the derivation rule below), MODULE_READS every module-scope name the body reads WITHOUT
calling it (the read rule below), CTX every field the body reads from the build's context dict, and LOCAL the
closures defined inside the body. Each HELPERS or CTX entry is one of:

  sig    an input the key folds, under the named labels (_FEED_MEMO_LABELS; several when the helper reads
         under more than one component); the first label is the one its main read rides;
  pure   a function of inputs already classified (a store the key identifies, identities another helper
         resolved) and nothing else; the note says of what;
  clock  the build's clock, handed to helpers whose clock-derived outputs LEAVE the entry (a placeholder's
         `t` and every card's age tint are stamped per build by the fold): tests/test_feed_session_memo.py's
         clock case pins that two builds apart in time differ in those fields alone.

Each MODULE_READS entry is one of:

  const  a module constant that never changes at runtime (an uppercase name bound once: a tuple or frozenset of
         strings, an int, a compiled regex, a class such as Path, a module alias); the note says what it is, and
         the test checks the value is of an immutable type;
  sig    a runtime table or module state whose content can change the entry, labelled under the key component
         that covers it, exactly as HELPERS does;
  pure   a read that cannot change the card, with a note saying why.

THE CALL CENSUS. The test derives the call set from the function's AST, every ast.Call in the body (nested defs,
lambdas, comprehensions and f-strings included), and requires it to EQUAL the tables' keys, so a helper added to
the body without a classification fails the suite by name (a future read must be labelled), and so does a stale
entry for one removed. The rule: a callee is reduced to its ROOT by walking down through attribute, subscript and
call nodes (`a.b`, `a[i]`, `a(...)`) until a node that is none of those, and is read under the dotted name of the
root joined with the attributes that follow it up to the first subscript or call: `_seg_key`,
`jd.load_goals_shared_or_fault`, `os.path.basename` (every attribute of a module chain), and `_auto_nudge_data`
for `_auto_nudge_data().get(...)` (the `.get` is a method on the value the classified call returned). A root that
is a Name is one of three things. A name the body binds (a parameter of the def, of a nested def or of a lambda;
an assignment, for, with, walrus or comprehension target; an except handler's name; a nested def's name) is a
LOCAL: a callee rooted in it (`tm.get`, `out.append`) is skipped, except a nested def's own call, which must be in
LOCAL. A name the kernel does not bind and the builtins module does is a builtin (`len`, `sorted`, `str`,
`dict.fromkeys`) and is skipped, `open` excepted: the one builtin that reads a file is classified like any helper.
Every other Name is a module-level name of the kernel (a helper, a module alias such as jd, em, cm, sb, os or
json, a class such as Sessions) and its dotted name MUST be in HELPERS, so nothing rooted in module scope passes
unlabelled, whatever the shape of the call. A root that is not a Name (a literal's method, `", ".join`; a
bool-op's, `(nd.get("x") or {}).get`; a path expression's, `(jd.STATE / "x.json").read_text`) is a method on a
value an expression produced: the calls inside that expression are walked on their own, and the method call is
subject to the EXPRESSION-METHOD RULE: every module-scope Name inside the callee expression that is not itself a
counted callee's root is a read (the read rule below counts it), and when there is at least one such read the
method call is reported as the first such read's dotted name (source order) joined with the method,
`jd.STATE.read_text` for `(jd.STATE / "x.json").read_text()`, and MUST be in HELPERS, since the method is what
reads (a Path constant reads nothing; its read_text reads a file). A method on an expression with no such read
inside (a local's, a literal's, a bool-op over locals, a classified call's value, `(_helper() or {}).get`) names
nothing of module scope that the census has not already counted, and is skipped.

THE READ CENSUS. Every ast.Name in Load context under the body is classified by the same three-way rule (a body
local skipped, a builtin the kernel does not bind skipped, `open` excepted), and every module-scope Name that is
NOT the root of a counted callee chain is a READ, under a dotted name: the Name alone when it is read bare or
subscripted (`_NEEDS_INPUT_STATES` for `perm_state in _NEEDS_INPUT_STATES`, `_node_anchor_rev` for
`_node_anchor_rev[fsid]`), or the Name joined with its first attribute for an attribute load (`jd.CITE_MIN_CHARS`,
`jd.STATE` for `jd.STATE / "x.json"`). The read set must EQUAL MODULE_READS' keys, as the call set must EQUAL
HELPERS plus LOCAL, so a module table read by subscript, a constant compared against, or a path built from a
module directory is labelled by name or fails. The only skips in either census are builtins and body locals:
there is no list of names or modules exempted.

Further pins: every `sig` label exists in the key's label tuple; every label in the tuple is claimed by some read
(no dead component); every LOCAL name is a def nested in the body; every HELPERS name resolves in the kernel to a
callable and every MODULE_READS name to a value; a `const` read's value is of an immutable type; the label tuple
matches the list the key builder's docstring documents, in order; the miss attribution map covers the labels plus
`cold`. The `row` component is a projection of the live row (2026-09-18): RowFieldCensus below derives, from each
row reader's source, the row fields it reads, and pins _feed_row_key to exactly their union. Names, not lines: the
tables say what each read is, the key builder's docstring says how each component is taken. The census enforces ONE level, the helpers the body calls directly and the module names it reads
directly; what each reads in turn is the classification's claim, verified by the differential cases in
tests/test_feed_session_memo.py.

THE REGISTRY CENSUS (2026-09-18). The key's `reg` component is an ALLOW-list: _feed_reg_sig folds the SDK registry
record's readable/missing/unreadable state and _FEED_REG_FIELDS alone. That flips the failure mode. Under the
deny-list it replaced (every field but the host journal's), a field the feed never read cost one extra derivation
per write; under the allow-list a field a feed reader takes up WITHOUT joining the list is a silent staleness, the
card serving on after the field moved. So this census is not one level deep like the two above: it walks EVERY
top-level function and method of the kernel and of the judge for a read of a registry field, and every reader is
classified in one of four tables, so a reader added in any of the RECEIVER SHAPES below is red until it is:
ON_FEED, the readers a derivation reaches, whose fields must EQUAL the allow-list; FOLDED_BY, the reads of
_sdk_sess (the loop's row for a live SDK sid discover cannot see yet), each landing in a row field another
component folds; NOT_CONSUMED, a read inside the body whose output no card consumes, held disjoint from the list
with the reason; OFF_FEED, the readers no derivation reaches, each with the surface it serves. A second pin holds
the PLACEMENT, not only the membership: a static callee walk from _feed_session_entry over the same functions (a
call by name, a `jd.<name>` call, a class-method call, and a bare reference to a function's name, so a callback
handed by name counts; a method called through `self` is not followed; the backend constructors _sdk_locked and
_codex are reached but never expanded, their edges being wiring, not derivation calls) must reach exactly ON_FEED
plus NOT_CONSUMED among the readers, so a feed helper that starts calling an OFF_FEED reader is red too.

A registry RECEIVER is one of these shapes, and no other (the rule is pinned on a synthetic module, shape by
shape): a call to _thread_reg or _thread_reg_read (and `[1]` of the latter's pair); a call whose callee's last name
is read_reg (`sbm.read_reg`, `read_reg`); a json.load or json.loads, or a def nested in the function that calls
one, whose argument is the registry path (the "sdk" path segment, SDKDIR, or a name bound, transitively, from an
expression naming them: the path, its text, a scandir or glob over the directory, an open's handle); a parameter
named `reg`; a parameter some function in the census passes a receiver to, under any name, whether a top-level
function or a def nested in the caller (to a fixpoint); a dict() or .copy() copy of a receiver, a dict display
merging one (`{**reg, ...}`), a walrus whose value is one, a bool-op or conditional over one, a list, set or
generator comprehension whose element is one; and a name, an attribute target such as `self.reg`, or a for or
comprehension target bound from any of these (the record half of a `state, reg = _thread_reg_read(sid)` unpack). A
READ is `.get("field")`, `["field"]` or `"field" in` on a receiver; a method on a field's VALUE
(`_thread_reg(sid).get("bgLedger")` iterated, its rows read) is not a registry read. Outside the rule, by design
and said here: a record that reaches a function through a container other than those shapes (a dict of records
built in another function, an object attribute set in another method), a field read by a variable rather than a
literal, and a registry field that reaches the kernel through a backend's own surface (the live row's authLive from
apiKeyAuth, be.thread_sessions()'s threadOf), which is that surface's, folded by `row` or read off the feed path;
the census reads the kernel's own decodes of the file.
