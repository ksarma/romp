"""One client-diag row per socket the kernel accepts (2026-09-15).

The kernel kept no durable record of page connections: an empty client-diag.jsonl read as a broken breadcrumb sink when
no browser had been on a page this kernel serves, and a count of GET /ws per app read as the attached dashboard's panes
when they may have been another kernel's federation relay dials. _note_ws_open files one `wsopen` row (surface kernel)
right after _register_ws_client: the app, the dashboard id, the shim's reconnect term, and the client's kind, decided once
at the handshake by _dial_kind(headers, query), by the terms the producers state: relay when the dial states relay=1
(the term the federation splice writes into the query it forwards); page when it states client=ext (the VS Code
extension host's connect URL, since Node's ws client sends no Origin and no User-Agent); page when it carries an Origin
or a User-Agent header (a browser carries both, a CLI such as curl a User-Agent); relay otherwise (no term, no header:
a hub kernel older than the relay term relaying a browser's federated dial, which states app and wid alone; bounded,
hubs update). The hub side of a spliced /remote/HOST/ws upgrade files its own row, kind hub, naming the host, only once
the remote has answered 101; a refusal files nothing. A row that cannot be written is said on stderr once.

Pins: the tell on the four shapes, and the extension's connect URL stating its term; the helper's row, through the same
capture tests/test_chat_window_spans.py uses for the kernel's other row, and the once-said failure; the handler end to
end, real upgrades with a browser's headers, with the extension host's bare headers and its term, with nothing stated
(the old hub's shape), and through a splice between two hermetic kernels (the hub's row after the remote's 101 and the
remote's relay row; a refused splice, no row), read back from the run's
client-diag.jsonl by their dashboard ids. Synthetic: an ephemeral server on the loopback, the run's own state root.
