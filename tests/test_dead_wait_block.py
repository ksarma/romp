"""A DORMANT session's stamped-awaiting Working card converts to a procedural block (the user
2026-08-22): the CLI died while a judged wait still stood, so nothing that could answer it is
running — yet a live awaiting stamp exempted the card from the whole ladder (wake, nudge, staller)
and it sat "paused" in Working forever (two live cards measured at 79 hours). The conversion is
event-triggered (the death transition; a boot catch-up sweep), once per stamp episode, stands down
for restart cuts (the resume machinery owns those), and its why is a recognized procedural block.
