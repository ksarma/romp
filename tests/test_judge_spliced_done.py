"""A prompt QUEUED into a running turn must never complete off that turn's unrelated work (the user 2026-07-29).

The incident: the user queued a question while the session was mid-turn on other work; the CLI
spliced it in (a queued_command attachment, stamped with its ENQUEUE time), and the process died
before any reply. The splice's segment absorbed the running turn's CONTINUING atoms — real assistant
work, none of it a reply to the spliced ask — so the no-work guard from the API-error fix
(_has_asst_work, the user 2026-07-25) passed, plan_units emitted a full work unit framed
"USER ASKED: … ASSISTANT SAID: [other work]", and a capable planner answered the question from its
own knowledge and filed done with a confabulated summary — 30 seconds after the ask was typed,
before the assistant's first post-splice token. Now the event model marks the synthesized splice
atom `absorbed`, and planner DONE ops filed off a spliced-trigger segment are stripped
(_strip_unevidenced_dones, spliced leg): work in such a segment is never proof the spliced ask — or any listed goal —
was answered. Mint/sub still apply (the ask gets its card, the tail work files), the goal stays
open — the truth — and the turn-level closer keeps done authority. SYNTHETIC fixtures only."""
