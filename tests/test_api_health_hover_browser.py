"""The API cell's hover History section, driven in a real browser (the user 2026-09-08).

The shell page is kernel-served HTML with inline CSS and JS, so it has no jsdom harness: the source pins
(ui/webview/api-health-hover.test.ts) hold the SHAPE and this module holds the BEHAVIOR. A scratch copy of
km._landing() is served from a temp directory over plain HTTP by a handler that also answers GET /api-health
with a synthetic signal (switchable between variants through /variant/<name>, so one page load exercises a
storm, a quiet tail across a restart, an empty signal, two buckets of one family and of two, an offline
window, a bucket the boot seeded, and tails longer than the cap); everything else 404s and the shell socket
is a shim that never opens, as in tests/test_api_health_browser.py. Playwright's chromium drives it: a frame
is handed to window.__rompApiHealth, the hover is opened by mouseenter / focus / Enter / click, and the driver
reports what the DOM did and how many reads the page made. Skips LOUDLY without the extension's node deps or
a browser (CI installs none).

Review round 1 added the executed cases the PR had pinned by source only: the newest read wins a race, a fresh
show drops the last answer, a pin after the hover reads once, the answer waits under a held pointer, the
section's place between the sessions and the tmux line, the family-only bucket name, the dated stamp and the
hour and day durations; and the fixes: Escape dismisses the focus-shown hover, tooltip and dialog roles by
mode, a window-refocus does not pop the hover, and the geometry at 830 px wide and on a short window. The
window-refocus trigger itself cannot be produced headless (bringToFront fires no window focus in Playwright's
chromium), so that case drives the mechanism with synthetic window and cell focus events in one task.

Review round 2: a real Tab out of an iframe onto the cell (the cell's keyboard path on the dashboard, where every pane
is an iframe; Chromium fires focus on the top window for the frame change, in the cell's own task) shows the hover;
the cell is described by a short summary, not the tip; a transition filed at asOf (the hover's own read) closes the
state before it; a bucket the boot seeded reads one time in the head, the divider and the boot's row; a mixed window
counts every attempt once and says how many had no status.

Review round 3: the previous kernel's last row filed in the same second as this kernel's start sits UNDER the restart
row (the boot is the kernel's start to the millisecond, the row seeded at it); a row filed after the start sits under
the clamped restart row with one restart mark, not a row and a divider; the cell's description at focus time, in the
focus's own task, carries the state word the frame put on the cell, and the landed one its since. Round 4: bootAt is
the clamped stamp itself (the backend serves its own seed stamp), so that row is the first pre-boot row.

Synthetic only: invented bucket labels, a fixed shape, times relative to the run so the same-day clock words
apply; no real data."""
