"""The kernel side of the shared read-only goal-store cache (kernel/judge.py load_goals_shared).

kernel/judge.py's load_goals_shared serves one deep-frozen parsed store per file version; this module pins
WHICH kernel sites load through it (the pusher's read-only sites), in which spelling (bare, or through the
per-session fault boundary jd.load_goals_shared_or_fault), and which deliberately do not (every writer,
the probe-then-write tick jobs), and drives the builders
over synthetic stores to show the cache in effect: each store parsed once per version across builds, the
frozen guard reaching a wired site without taking the frame down, the compaction sweep's eviction, and
one session's failed chat build no longer aborting the whole push. Synthetic fixtures only: placeholder
sids, invented goal text, transcript paths that do not exist (a lane with no transcript still builds)."""
