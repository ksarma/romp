"""tests/conftest.py's report redaction (2026-09-05): no test report may print a value from the
process environment, or a credential-shaped token from anywhere.

The assertion rule the suite follows (never render an environment mapping, never compare a
credential's value in a message) is what keeps a live key off a terminal; the hook is the safety net
for the assertion nobody wrote that way. Pinned here:
  RedactionRule: the value set (16 characters or more; exempt, never when the name is
    credential-shaped: path-valued names, the shell's and the ones GitHub Actions exports, the names
    whose values are public, the ones GitHub Actions describes a run in and the conftest's own
    synthetic git identity, the XDG_* and PYTEST_* families, and any value that is an absolute path
    this machine has) and the replacement (every occurrence, longest value first, each
    whitespace-separated chunk of a value that is 16 characters or more, because pprint renders a
    value with spaces as adjacent literals on separate lines and a whole-value replace misses them,
    and each piece of a value left beside a cut pytest or unittest made, `'<head>...<tail>'` and
    `[N chars]`, when it is a substring of a value: pytest keeps 12 and 13 characters of a failed
    `==`'s operands, so most of a 30-character value stood on the assert line).
  WriteTimeCapture: a value is noted the moment it is written into os.environ (a plain assignment,
    update, setdefault, os.putenv, os.environb, mock.patch.dict), so a value present only between the
    per-test samples is redacted too.
  CredentialPattern: the second net, independent of provenance: credential-shaped tokens by pattern
    (tests/credential_patterns.py) in any report, pytest's own renderings of a failed comparison
    included (the diff's `- <a>` and `+ <a>` lines under the E marker, the quoted operands of an
    `assert '<a>' == '<b>'`, a --showlocals line `name = '<a>'`, the `+  where '<a>' = f()` and
    `+  and   '<b>' = g()` lines, the haystack of `assert '<a>' in '<b>'` and unittest's `'<a>' not
    found in '<b>'`, the elements of a list, tuple or set repr, unittest's `Lists differ:` line, its
    quoted per-element lines and its diff of a container spread over lines, and the fragments of a
    value pytest ellipsized at default verbosity or unittest shortened with `[N chars]`); a JWT by its
    shape wherever it sits, cut or whole (a cut inside its header up to the header bound, and the stated
    limit past it); the dotted rest of a token that qualifies; the head of a cut
    key bounded at the widest cut a tool makes, and a wider head taken with its cut and tail by the
    format rule, quoted or bare; the `hf_` and `rpa_` rules' letters-and-digits class and its cost;
    the fragment rule's documented costs (a camelCase name or a digit-bearing run against a cut is
    redacted, a Capitalised word or a single-case identifier is not); the two runs on the sides of one
    cut taken together when either qualifies, whatever the other's alphabet (a letters-only hex tail
    stood in the clear beside its redacted head on CI, 2026-09-08), with the floor on both sides and a
    pair where neither qualifies left alone; the signed lines of pytest's diff of two compared strings
    after its identical-prefix (or -suffix) skip, which show a rest of each operand too short for any
    rule (22 characters of each 64-character secret stood in the clear, 2026-09-08), redacted when the
    assert line above rendered an operand as markers alone and left as they were under a plain string's
    assert line; and the two shapes the generic rule fires on but leaves alone, a named git sha and a
    dated Anthropic model id.
  ScrubCost: the scrub is linear: a 200 KB adversarial line (a run of repeated prefixes, of one case,
    of digits, of dashes, of dots, a pair of runs around one cut, a redacted compare over a 200 KB diff
    line) is scrubbed within a generous budget; the first of them took 80 seconds before the cut-key
    rule's head was bounded.
  ReportShapes: the hook's work on a report object of each outcome (a failure's longrepr, a skip's
    tuple, a passed test's sections); a changed failure keeps its crash location, its message scrubbed
    in pytest's E-marked rendering, through xdist's serialization round trip.
  HookEndToEnd: subprocess pytest runs against a copy of the conftest. A test that fails with a probe
    value in its message and on its stdout prints the marker, never the value, and its short summary
    line still ends in the assertion message; the same for a value
    set inside mock.patch.dict and gone before the assertion, a header-shaped value split by
    assertDictEqual, a pattern-shaped token with no provenance, a passed test's captured output
    under -rA, a collection error, a failed comparison of two unknown-format tokens under
    --showlocals (pytest's diff lines, its assert line and the locals all show the marker), and the
    where/and/in/not-found/Lists-differ/Tuples-differ renderings of two such tokens at default
    verbosity, and the ellipsized renderings of two keys and two 64-character tokens compared with
    `==` (as strings, in a list, in a tuple, and through unittest's `[N chars]` shortening); a
    comparison of two 64-character values sharing 52 leading (or the first and 52 trailing) characters,
    whose diff pytest skips down to 22 or 21 characters of each, shows the marker on both signed lines,
    in the failure and in CI's repeat of the message; pytest's own cut onto a letters-only piece of a
    hex value (a 13-letter tail, a 12-letter head) shows the marker on both pieces; a cut
    comparison of a 30-character environment value shows the marker for both of its pieces; and a
    comparison of a GitHub Actions variable, or of the conftest's own git identity, shows the value.

Every probe value is synthetic and assembled at run time ("romp-test-fixture-" + a uuid; a
pattern-shaped probe is a public key prefix joined to uuids), so no literal in this file is a
credential. A case whose assertion depends on which characters a piece carries (the fragment rule
wants a digit or mixed case) draws nothing: its value is the hex digest of a fixed tag, the same on
every run, and a letters-only piece is the hex alphabet's six letters cycled. A uuid's 13-character
piece lacks a digit one draw in 345,000 and an 8-character one in 2,560, and one such draw failed
this module on CI (2026-09-08).
