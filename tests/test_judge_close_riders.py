"""The closer caps its RIDERS per call (CLOSE_RIDER_CAP, 2026-09-03) — never the turn's own menu.

The incident: one session's closer calls were alarm-killed 192 times in a row inside ONE
_close_session walk (6h22m during which every judge for every session was silent). The kills were
healthy-but-slow calls, not hangs: served closer duration tracks OUTPUT tokens, and the output size
comes from the menu — _close_turn appended every rider (steps-finished + starved + status + lifted)
with no count cap, 24 riders on most of the backlog, so every reply was a 24-entry JSON plus
unbounded thinking, and did not fit under the alarm. Self-sustaining, because riders retire only
through the closerLookT stamp a LANDED reply writes: a killed call stamps nothing, the identical
menu rides the next turn's call, and dies identically.

The cap is a DRAIN, not a fairness cap (the 2026-06-30 no-fairness-caps stance stands): lifted /
steps-finished / starved riders re-nominate until stamped, so whatever is cut rides a later landed
call (later, not always the next: a verdict a landed call files re-arms its earlier-stamped siblings)
— a finite backlog, the same argument DEATH_DRAIN_PER_PASS makes. STATUS riders are never cut: they
are turn-scoped and one-shot (no watermark), so a cut one would be lost from the very reply it was to
be judged from, not deferred; they take their room off the cap first, and the re-nominating riders
fill what is left.
