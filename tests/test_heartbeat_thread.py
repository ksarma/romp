"""WS heartbeat isolation (bin/romp-kernel). The keepalive must live on its OWN thread, not inside the
pusher loop: when the beat rode _pusher, a heavy _push_all() under GIL contention could stretch one loop
iteration past the shim's STALE_MS watchdog, and the client force-closed a healthy socket — the false
"disconnected / reconnecting" banner (2026-07-20). These tests pin (a) the beat arriving on cadence with
NO pusher running at all, (b) beats continuing while a push is wedged, and (c) the pusher no longer
carrying the beat inline (source pin, so a refactor can't quietly move it back).
