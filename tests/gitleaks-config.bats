# .gitleaks.toml and the credential scan, exercised against the REAL scanner
# (tests/install-sh.bats stubs it, because what it tests there is the hook's
# wiring; what is under test here is the config itself, and what a push through
# the hook looks like when gitleaks really runs, which a stub cannot check).
#
# Skipped when gitleaks is not installed, so a clone that never wanted the
# scanner still runs a green suite; CI installs it and is the arbiter.
# ROMP_GITLEAKS names a binary that is not on PATH, as it does for the hook.
#
# Nothing in this file may contain a credential-shaped literal: gitleaks scans
# this repo, and a fixture secret written out longhand would flag the very test
# that proves the scanner works. The probes below are assembled at run time and
# only ever exist in a temp file.
