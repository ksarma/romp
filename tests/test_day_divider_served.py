"""T339 (the user 2026-09-11, screenshot): the chat's day divider. Three faults on the real /chat page of a hermetic kernel:
(1) the rail's vertical line broke above and below the divider; (2) the date sat at the prose edge with the hairline to its
right alone; (3) a collapsed run of notices whose FIRST member carried yesterday's time among today's rows drew a
"Yesterday" divider inside today and wore yesterday's clock. The producer of (3), history now: a session's LIVE echo
atoms (the kernel's own copies of sent messages, kept until the transcript lands their text; persisted in the registry's
`echoes` mirror and reseeded at boot) were merged into the chat's LAST turn sorted by their own SEND time (kernel.py, the
live-atom merge), so a romp notice sent yesterday whose text never landed sat right after the previous turn's rows, among
today's, stamped yesterday, and two such echoes folded into one notice run timed by its first. T339 closed the walk's side
(a forward-only crossing against a high-water mark, time-marker.ts DayWalk); T344 closed the producer (2026-09-11): an
echo stamped before the last turn's start is placed by its send time, into the turn whose window holds it or into a
closed turn of its own in the gap where it was sent (one per gap, so echoes sent together stay a run), and only an echo at
or after the last turn's start still takes the tail. So the rows the chat reads are in time order and the walk needs no
special case; this lab reads that order off the served page.

Two synthetic sessions on one kernel. `web`: rows two days ago, yesterday and today (two turns), the registry mirroring two
echoes of romp notices, the first sent yesterday 09:47 (the gap between the two-days-ago turn and yesterday's), the second
today 00:12 (the gap between today's two turns). `api`: the same shape read a day later, rows all yesterday and both echoes
two days ago, before the first turn: one synthetic turn LEADING the transcript. Asserted, dark and light: every timed row
is in time order and each echo row wears its OWN local HH:MM; `web` shows two dividers only (the weekday over two days
ago, "Yesterday" whose next row is the 09:47 echo, now yesterday's first row, not the 10:00 row) and no collapsed run
at all (the two echoes are a day apart, no longer adjacent); `api` shows the weekday divider leading the transcript over
the notice run (whose head anchors on its latest member, 09:41, its previous sibling the divider), then exactly ONE
"Yesterday" over the first real row; each divider's label is centered in the column between two hairlines of equal width;
the divider's rail segment is painted on the turns' own line (the same page x) and reaches the neighbouring turns' boxes
above and below (painted geometry, not the rule text); a divider that leads the transcript (nothing on the rail above it:
the first child, or the one after the pinned system-context card, which sits off the rail) draws no segment and the turn
after it starts its rail where a first turn does. The top-of-view day-context label (render.ts paintRailSticky) reads the
day WALK's mark at the top row (its marker's data-day, stampWalkDay), not the row's own moment (T342: it used to read the
row's own epoch, so a stale echo among yesterday's rows said "2 days ago" under a "Yesterday" divider). Under the
placement `api`'s stale run LEADS the transcript, so the walk's mark at its head is the run's own anchor (nothing passed
before it): scrolled to the top line in a short viewport, the label reads the run's own day, "2 days ago", the day its
weekday divider opens, while the run's head keeps its own HH:MM (before T344's placement, with the echoes merged into the last turn, the run sat inside yesterday's turn,
the same label read "Yesterday", the walk's day there). The browser's clock is pinned to the epoch the fixture was stamped
from, so a run that crosses local midnight between the boot and the drive still agrees with itself.

With DD_SHOTS=<dir> the driver writes screenshots (dark and light, the `web` session); DD_BEFORE_DIST=<dist> serves another
tree's bundle for the before shots and skips the assertions, unless DD_BEFORE_ASSERT=1 keeps them (how T339 was proven
red against the bundle before its change: a third divider inside today above `web`'s notice run; and, against the branch
before the high-water mark, a second "Yesterday" in `api`). The T344 half is red against a KERNEL before the change, the
bundle as is: the echoes then sat in the last turn, so `web`'s rows stepped back in time and its "Yesterday" opened the
10:00 row (not the 09:47 echo), and `api` had no weekday divider leading the transcript (its stale run sat among
yesterday's rows, with nothing opening its day). Skips LOUDLY without the extension deps or a Playwright browser; the
extension CI job installs Chromium and runs served files with ROMP_SERVED_TESTS_REQUIRE=1, which turns any skip into a
failure there. SYNTHETIC fixtures only (sessions web and api, invented notice texts, the notes-api demo world)."""
