"""build_feed's per-session card memo (T368): a rebuild re-derives only the sessions whose inputs moved.

The pusher keeps the whole feed payload while nothing on the board changes, but any change anywhere rebuilt it
whole, and the rebuild walked every living session's goal tree and per-session derivations (the loop body of
build_feed, now _feed_session_entry) whether or not that session had moved: a cost that scaled with sessions
times goals, not with what changed. The memo (_feed_memo) holds each session's derived entry under a key of every
input the derivation reads (_feed_session_key), invalidated by those inputs alone and never by the clock.

This module drives the REAL build_feed over a hermetic three-session board (the notes-api demo world: web, api
and tests, each with a transcript, a names entry, a live row and a goal store holding one top-level goal) and
pins, per build, how many sessions were derived (/perf builds.feed.memo `derived`) and which component the miss
was attributed to, beside the card the moved input changes:
  * cold: three derivations; unchanged: none; a memoized build equals a from-scratch build byte for byte;
  * one input at a time, each re-deriving ITS session only: a judge verdict (the store file), a user gesture
    (the override journal), a clear (the session's slice of cleared.jsonl), a live-row change, a transcript
    append, a states append, a names rewrite, the hideFromFeed flag;
  * a peer's verdict re-derives the session whose card reads that peer's store (the peers dependency);
  * nudge facts re-derive only cards that read the changed node, including foreign node ids; unrelated
    bookkeeping and undisplayed history do not invalidate, and concurrent writes wait for the next snapshot;
  * a deferral record (the ledger's `deferred` map: the Stalled section, the Blocked filing) minted or retired
    for a node re-derives the card that read that exact node id, a foreign-owned id included, and no other;
  * a judge pass beginning or ending: nothing derives while the stores' versions stand; a mid-pass publish and a
    mid-pass journal row re-derive their session at the next build and once more at the pass end; a pass
    beginning between the key's stat and the body's read keys the entry as what it rendered; a rewrite the
    stat does not show reaches the card at the next pass;
  * the clock: two builds ten minutes apart derive nothing and differ in `now`, `buildId` and the cards' age
    tint alone (the fold stamps trgb per build; the memo holds nothing clock-derived);
  * the byte bound (FEED_MEMO_BYTES): entries leave oldest first, counted, and the payload stays complete;
  * a departed session's entry leaves with it; GET /perf reports the memo's counters;
  * one session's card build raising is CONTAINED (2026-09-17), the decode of its memoized entry and its key included:
    the other sessions' cards ship, the failure is counted (`failed`, cumulative; `failing`, the sessions whose build is
    failing now) and said once per (session, cause) episode on stderr and as a bell row, the session's previous cards
    are served when the memo holds a decodable entry (never memoized; an entry that no longer decodes is dropped), and
    a build that serves or derives the session ends the episode, so a later fault is said anew.

Harness: tests/test_payload_dedup_invariant.py's world (a hermetic state root the kernel's judge is rebound to,
names/ entries and projects/<launch dir>/<sid>.jsonl transcripts discover finds, a fixed live map, a warm first
build so the session-order adoption sits behind the compared builds), extended to three sessions with goal
stores minted the way tests/test_kernel_goal_cache_wiring.py mints them (jd.apply_plan, jd.rollup_status,
jd.save_goals). The parses stay cold, as the feed reads them (cache-only), so a card here is the store's card.
Synthetic fixtures only: private synthetic sids (the goal-store fixture rule: load_goals replays the per-sid
override journal, so a shared placeholder sid would be re-flagged by other modules' rows), invented text.

        field nobody reads. The `reg` component takes the record's state and its allow-listed fields alone
        (_feed_reg_sig, 2026-09-18); before, it folded every field but the host journal's, and each of these writes
        re-derived the session's cards though no card reads them. The two payload equalities are a regression belt,
        not the proof that the body reads none of these: this board has no SDK backend and no live snapshot, so
        _bg_live_norm answers [] before it reaches the ledger and the parse is cache-only, which makes the
        equalities hold whatever the body reads. The proof is the census in tests/test_feed_memo_inputs.py

        the feed's readers name ARE the allow-list."""

class ThePassBoundaryIsNotAnInput(_Board):
    """A judge pass beginning or ending moves no key whose store did not (2026-09-16). The `store` component used to
    carry the pass snapshot's clock stamp (_goals_snap_at[0] while the sid was in the snapshot, None between passes),
    so every pass boundary re-derived every snapshotted session under the label `store` although the store the body
    renders was the same memoized object or the same file version. On a busy board with short passes running back to
    back that was most of the derivations: of the roughly eight misses per build carrying the store label (miss_by
    attributes a miss to every differing label), 5.7 to 7.9 per build carried no other label, against about one
    store publish per build. The component now names the store VERSION the body renders (the snapshot entry's decode
    key mid-pass, the live file's identity between passes, each beside the pass memo's count of byte changes the stat
    did not show for that store) and whether the override journal is replayed onto it (the live loader replays it, the
    raw snapshot does not until a punch), so an unchanged store serves across the boundary and the one real change,
    the version the body renders moving, still re-derives. Both are taken from the read the body renders
    (_feed_goals_keyed reports the snapshot key it served from, inside its own lock hold), so a pass boundary between
    the key's stat and the body's read cannot pair one mode's key with the other mode's rendering.

    Named follow-up, not done here: the replay bit flips at every boundary for every session whose journal FILE
    exists (journals are never pruned, and the replay is a no-op whenever the kernel's own save survived), so such a
    session still derives twice per pass under `store`. Tightening it needs a fold watermark the store carries (the
    journal identity save_goals folded, popped like _baseRev) so the bit means the journal has rows after the fold,
    not that a journal exists.

    The pass here is the real _begin_goals_pass over this board's store directory: the pass memo it swaps in is the
    process's, saved and restored, and the snapshot is always dropped again (a failing assertion would otherwise
    leave one installed for every later module in a serial run)."""
