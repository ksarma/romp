"""One client that stops draining must not stall the clients behind it.

The kernel's send loops are SHARED and serial: _keepalive_all walks every connected client in one
thread, handing each the ~40-byte heartbeat. When that walk wrote to sockets directly, a client whose
buffer was full parked the whole walk, so every client after it received nothing — and the browser shim
force-closes any socket silent for STALE_MS (30s).

That is what "the dashboard keeps losing its connection" turned out to be (the user 2026-07-28),
diagnosed from the panes' own drop logs: chat, feed and timeline dropping at IDENTICAL 35s intervals
(STALE_MS plus one 5s watchdog tick), in lockstep. Three independent sockets falling silent at the same
instant is one shared upstream stall, not three socket failures.

Why a send timeout is NOT the fix (asserted below so it is not "simplified" back in):
  - settimeout() puts the socket in non-blocking mode, and the client's handler thread is parked in a
    blocking read on that same socket; dup() shares the file-status flags, so it does not escape either.
  - select()-then-send() does not bound it: on Linux a BLOCKING send() transmits the whole buffer,
    blocking as needed. Short writes are non-blocking-socket behaviour. This test's first version hung
    for exactly that reason.
The fix is structural: each client owns a queue and a sender thread, and shared loops only enqueue.

Real TCP loopback throughout, matching the kernel's actual transport (AF_UNIX socketpairs behave
differently again and would not represent it). Synthetic only: no session data.
