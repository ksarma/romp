"""An answered wake files its outcome row whatever store its caller holds (2026-09-09).

The nudge walk (_auto_nudge_session) reads a session's goal store through the shared read-only view
(kernel/judge.py load_goals_shared_or_fault) and hands that view to _wake_goal. When the judges have
ruled on a wake's answer, the answered leg records answeredAt and files the answer into the goal's
diary (_file_wake_answer): that row is the event the closer's filed-since gate reads, so it re-audits
with the answer in view. The filing writes (record_verdict, rollup_status, save_goals), so it must take
its own writer load of the store: a write through the frozen view raises FrozenStoreError inside the
helper's own catch, and the caller sees only a False return. Before the fix, the first answered wake
per kernel process filed no row and never retried, a frozen-store-write judge-errors row was filed,
and the shared cache switched itself off until the next restart (regression:
https://github.com/romp-on/romp/pull/1141; the other caller, _awaiting_wake_outcomes, already loaded
a writer copy and was unaffected).

The tests here drive the real path: a file-backed store under a private synthetic sid, read by the
REAL shared loader (never stubbed), the walk's own store binding, and the answered leg with the
response judgment stubbed to "answered and ruled" (the response gates are pinned elsewhere; the
mechanism under test is the write moment). SYNTHETIC fixtures only."""
