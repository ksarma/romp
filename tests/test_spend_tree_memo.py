"""T401 follow-up (2026-09-13): the spend guard listed every alive session's subagents tree WHOLE on the pusher thread in the
boot's first cycle (4.2 s on one boot: 60 trees, 16,752 agent transcripts in 1,542 directories, the largest 2,581 files). The
guard's job skips the boot's first cycle, and the tree memo is persisted (STATE/spend-tree/<sid>.json, written when dirty and at
exit) and loaded lazily when the session's guard first runs, so a boot stats directories and lists nothing until one moves; a
corrupt memo relists; the reads are counted under memos.spendTree. Round two: the load saves the listings, and the one stat per
file that remains (an append while the kernel was down moves no directory's mtime) is spread over the cycles that follow,
hot first, at most SPEND_GUARD_RESTAT_PER_CYCLE a cycle; a memo naming another root or a foreign path is not trusted; the
directory is swept of memos whose leaf is gone; the exit's write retries a dump under the pusher's mutation. Synthetic trees only."""
