"""Golden contract tests for the rebuilt bottom-layer parser (bin/romp-event-model).

Each scenario builds a SYNTHETIC transcript (invented prompt text, placeholder
UUIDs, hostname TESTHOST — never real session data, per CLAUDE.md), runs the
REAL parse_session on it with a fixed clock, and compares the full Session ->
Turn -> Atom tree against a checked-in golden JSON file. The unit classes below
pin the subtle invariants that are hard to eyeball in a JSON diff: author
classification, the absorb-vs-queue turn boundary, turn/segment derivation,
`ended` inference, the resume/clear lineage walk, idle-from-the-state-log, and
popAll.

Run:    python3 tests/test_event_model_golden.py
Regen:  python3 tests/test_event_model_golden.py --regen   (then REVIEW the diff)
