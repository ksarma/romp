"""One git runner for every test fixture that builds a throwaway repository (T298, T299).

Every git the fixtures run forbids BACKGROUND work. `git commit` (and fetch, merge, rebase, am) spawns
`git maintenance run --auto`, which on recent git detaches from its parent (maintenance.autoDetach, on by
default; older git's `gc --auto` detached once it had work), so the child can still be writing into .git
while a fixture's TemporaryDirectory removes the repo: the CI flake "OSError: [Errno 39] Directory not
empty: '.git'" from rmtree (tests/test_restart_classifier.py, the Python 3.10 job, 2026-09-10). The keys
below ride every invocation as -c flags, and init_repo / forbid_background write them into the repo's own
config so a git that the KERNEL runs against the repo, through its own subprocess, obeys them too. The
fsmonitor daemon is off for the same reason on hosts where git has one.

The runner keeps each fixture's habits as parameters rather than choosing for them: the identity (every
file commits as its own synthetic author), the timeout, whether a failure raises, the environment (files
that pin git's config floor pass GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL and friends themselves), and text or bytes output. It
returns the CompletedProcess; a file's local wrapper keeps whatever shape its call sites expect (a
stripped stdout, an AssertionError instead of CalledProcessError, nothing).
