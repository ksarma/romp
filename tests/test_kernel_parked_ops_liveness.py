"""Parked ops deliver on the SETTLE event, independent of the judge pass (2026-09-03).

The kernel parks a user's input while its session is busy, compacting, or limit-held, and delivers the
queue FIFO once the session is quiet (_apply_pending_ops). Until this change the ONLY caller of that
function was the tail of the judge producer's pass, after an untimed join on the judge tiers — so every
parked op in every session waited for the judges to finish. A judge pass can run for hours: one session's
closer sweep, alarm-killed turn after turn, held a pass for 6h22m, and a typed /clear parked mid-turn sat
as a queued chip the whole time until the user cancelled it. The drain now rides the pusher cycle, woken
by the backends' turn-end poke (_wake_kernel), by /tick, by every queue mutation, and by its own 0.5 s
backstop; the producer never touches it.

SYNTHETIC fixtures only: a placeholder uuid, invented texts.
