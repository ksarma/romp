"""The test suite's file-path importer: `from romp_load import load_source`.

Every test module loads the code under test by path through the stable bin/ names
(`load_source("romp_kernel", os.path.join(BIN, "romp-kernel"))`). Until 2026-09 that was
`SourceFileLoader(...).load_module()`, which Python 3.15 removes; the replacement is
kernel/loadsource.py, and this module is how a test reaches it without a package import. It is
importable under every way the suite runs: pytest and `python -m unittest tests.test_x` import
the tests package first, whose __init__ registers this module under the bare name; a direct
`python tests/test_x.py` (or `cd tests && python -m unittest test_x`) has this directory on
sys.path already.

The semantics a test may lean on are load_module()'s, kept on purpose: a name already in
sys.modules is re-executed into the SAME module object, so a test that loads `romp_judge` and then
`romp_kernel` gets a kernel whose `jd` IS its own `jd` handle (and a `_rebind_state` on one is seen
by the other). A test that needs a private copy loads under a private name, as before.
