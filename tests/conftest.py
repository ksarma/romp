# Temp-directory hygiene, the child-process half (2026-09-06): every temp path a run creates lives
# under ONE private root, removed when the run ends. tests/__init__.py's mkdtemp hook (the other
# half; its comment has the leak's history) records and removes what THIS process mints through
# tempfile.mkdtemp, but a test's children — kernels, git, `mktemp -d` in a shell — and mkstemp or
# os.mkdir paths are outside its sight (a full run left ~5,600 of those per run at up to ten a
# second). So the process's temp dir is redirected: tempfile.tempdir is set directly (gettempdir()
# caches its first answer, and tests/__init__.py has already called it by the time this runs), and
# TMPDIR is exported so every child inherits the same root. Import-time, not pytest_configure: this
# module's own XDG floor below and every module-level mkdtemp at collection must land inside it.
# The two removals compose without overlap: pytest_sessionfinish runs the hook's sweep, whose scope
# is gettempdir() and so the inside of this root; pytest_unconfigure then removes the root whole
# (whatever the sweep could not see) and tests/__init__.py's romp-tests-state-* dir — the package
# imports first, so that dir and this root were minted before the redirect and are the two things a
# run puts outside the root; the hook recorded both but skips them as outside its scope. Under
# pytest-xdist both hooks run in the controller and in every worker: each imported this file and so
# owns a root of its own (a worker's sits inside the controller's, since it inherits that TMPDIR).
# The atexit registrations are silent fallbacks for a normal exit that skipped the hooks, each a
# no-op on what the other removed; nothing runs after an os._exit (pytest-timeout's thread method
# ends a hung run that way), so a hang leaves two top-level entries in the system temp dir, this
# root and that state dir, both under the romp-tests- prefix.
# The system temp dir — the one the RUN was handed, before any redirect — is recorded once, by the
# first conftest to import: an xdist worker inherits the controller's record along with its TMPDIR
# (setdefault, not an assignment: a worker's own gettempdir() is the controller's root, and
# recording that put the worker's fallback one level deeper than a socket path can bear under a
# long TMPDIR — four socket tests failed at bind under -n 2). A test that must leave the root (an
# AF_UNIX socket path that would not fit sun_path under a nested root) falls back to it, and only

# before each test and fails the test that changed one and did not restore it, or left a path that

# of it, on a launch env) prints the whole mapping when it fails, and on a developer's box that
# mapping holds live credentials. Assertions that test membership and name the key are the fix; this
# hook is the safety net for an assertion still written the other way. Two nets, applied to every
# report's text (the longrepr and the captured-output sections) whatever the outcome, and to
# collection reports:
#   * every value seen in this process's environment, 16 characters or longer, is replaced with one
#     marker, and so is each whitespace-separated chunk of such a value that is 16 characters or
#     longer (pprint renders a value with spaces as adjacent literals on separate lines, so a
#     whole-value replace misses the pieces), and so is each piece of such a value that pytest or
#     unittest left beside a cut (`'<head>...<tail>'`, `[N chars]`: a failed `==` keeps 12 and 13
#     characters of each operand, so most of a 30-character value showed on the assert line and in
#     the short summary, 2026-09-07). Values are noted the moment they are WRITTEN into
#     os.environ (the mutation path is wrapped below: a plain assignment, update, setdefault,
#     os.putenv, os.environb, mock.patch.dict), and sampled at import, around each test and at
#     report time as well, for values that entered by another route (inherited from the parent
#     process, written by a C extension). Exempt, and never when the name is credential-shaped: a
#     path-valued variable by NAME (the shell's, this conftest's own dirs, the interpreter and
#     workspace paths GitHub Actions exports); a variable whose value is public by NAME (the ones
#     GitHub Actions exports to describe the run: the server URLs, the sha, the ref, the workflow
#     and job names, the repository and the actor, each of which a CI failure report was showing as
#     the marker, 2026-09-07; and the synthetic git identity this conftest sets at import); a name
#     family that is never a credential (XDG_*, and pytest's own PYTEST_*: PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST holds
#     the running test's node id and is written for every phase of every test, so noting it grew the
#     set by one value per test, slowed every report's scrub in step and made the node id of every
#     test already run a target in later reports); and any value that IS a path this machine has
#     (one absolute path that exists, or a PATH-style list of them), because a traceback quotes the
#     interpreter's prefix on every frame and a developer's shell names it under any variable (a
#     pyenv root, a conda prefix).
#   * credential-shaped tokens by PATTERN (tests/credential_patterns.py: the public key prefixes, and
#     a long token in a value position), whatever their provenance: a token that never touched the
#     environment (read from a file, printed by a child) is caught by this one.
# A report the hook leaves alone keeps pytest's own object and rendering. One it changes is rebuilt
# from the scrubbed text as a native-style traceback with its crash location kept (its message
# scrubbed too), so the short test summary still ends in the assertion message, junitxml keeps its
# message and xdist carries it to the controller; that report loses colour and source highlighting,
