# Temp-directory hygiene, the child-process half (2026-09-06): every temp path a run creates lives
# under ONE private root, removed when the run ends. tests/__init__.py's mkdtemp hook (the other
# half; its comment has the leak's history) records and removes what THIS process mints through
# tempfile.mkdtemp, but a test's children — kernels, git, `mktemp -d` in a shell — and mkstemp or
# os.mkdir paths are outside its sight (a full run left ~5,600 of those per run at up to ten a
# second). So the process's temp dir is redirected: tempfile.tempdir is set directly (gettempdir()
# caches its first answer, and tests/__init__.py has already called it by the time this runs), and
# TMPDIR is exported so every child inherits the same root. Import-time, not pytest_configure: this
# module's own XDG floor below and every module-level mkdtemp at collection must land inside it.
# The two removals compose without overlap: pytest_sessionfinish runs the hook's sweep, whose scope
# is gettempdir() and so the inside of this root; pytest_unconfigure then removes the root whole
# (whatever the sweep could not see) and tests/__init__.py's romp-tests-state-* dir — the package
# imports first, so that dir and this root were minted before the redirect and are the two things a
# run puts outside the root; the hook recorded both but skips them as outside its scope. Under
# pytest-xdist both hooks run in the controller and in every worker: each imported this file and so
# owns a root of its own (a worker's sits inside the controller's, since it inherits that TMPDIR).
# The atexit registrations are silent fallbacks for a normal exit that skipped the hooks, each a
# no-op on what the other removed; nothing runs after an os._exit (pytest-timeout's thread method
# ends a hung run that way), so a hang leaves two top-level entries in the system temp dir, this
# root and that state dir, both under the romp-tests- prefix.
# The system temp dir — the one the RUN was handed, before any redirect — is recorded once, by the
# first conftest to import: an xdist worker inherits the controller's record along with its TMPDIR
# (setdefault, not an assignment: a worker's own gettempdir() is the controller's root, and
# recording that put the worker's fallback one level deeper than a socket path can bear under a
# long TMPDIR — four socket tests failed at bind under -n 2). A test that must leave the root (an
# AF_UNIX socket path that would not fit sun_path under a nested root) falls back to it, and only
