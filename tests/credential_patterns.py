"""Credential-shaped tokens, by pattern: the one list two places scrub with.

tests/conftest.py's report redaction removes every value seen in the process environment. That net
cannot see a token that never touched the environment (read from a file, printed by a child process,
typed into a fixture). This is the second net, independent of provenance: the key formats an
installation may meet, each as the prefix its provider fixed plus a long tail, one format fixed by
its shape rather than a prefix (a JWT), and one generic rule for a token of unknown format. The live
session-move test scrubs a child's output with the same list before a failure renders it
(tests/test_session_move_live.py), so the two cannot drift.

The generic rule fires on a token of 24 characters or more that has a digit (a hex, base64 or random
token of that length has one with near certainty, while a long identifier does not, so
`testMethod=test_a_long_descriptive_name` in a failure header stays readable), and on one of 40 or
more that mixes upper and lower case with no digit. It applies where a value sits (after `=`, after
`:` or `: `, after `Bearer `, inside the quotes of a dict repr, as an element of a list, tuple or set
repr: after `[`, `(`, `{` or `, `), to a line that is one such token and nothing else, which is what
an apiKeyHelper's stdout is, and to pytest's own renderings of a failed comparison, which are value
positions too though nothing marks them as one: the `- <token>` and `+ <token>` lines of its diff
under the `E` marker (a container's elements spread over such lines included), the quoted operands
of `assert '<a>' == '<b>'` (and unittest's `'<a>' != '<b>'`), the haystack of `assert '<a>' in '<b>'`
(unittest's `'<a>' not found in '<b>'`), the `+  where '<a>' = f()` and `+  and   '<b>' = g()` lines
that explain an assert's operands, unittest's `Lists differ:` line and the quoted element lines under
it, and a `--showlocals` line `name = '<token>'`. A match takes the dotted rest of its token with it
(`.` and more token characters, any number of times), so a dotted token whose first run qualifies is
taken whole (`<32 hex>.<signature>`, a JWT whose header is longer than the JWT rule's bound) rather
than up to its first dot; a dot with nothing of a token after it (a sentence's, an ellipsis) is never
taken. Two shapes it leaves alone: the segment after a pytest node id's `::` (a test's name, not a
value), and a 40-hex git sha named as a commit (`commit: <sha>`, `{'commit': '<sha>'}`) or sitting
in a path or after an `@`. It still matches a synthetic uuid in a value position and a test method
name with a digit in it, so a failing dict comparison may show the marker where a test's placeholder
sid was, and a digit-bearing file name in a value position loses its extension to the dotted rest
(`file=<name>.py`, a uuid-named file alone on a line). That is the cost of catching a token of
unknown format; the failure is still readable.

A JWT (RFC 7519) has no provider prefix but a fixed shape: base64url segments joined by dots, the
first the JOSE header, a JSON object, whose encoding therefore begins `eyJ` (`{"` in base64). The
rule takes `eyJ`, the rest of a header segment of 10 to JWT_HEADER_MAX characters (the shortest
header, `{"alg":"none"}`, encodes to 19), and one to four more segments: a signed token has three,
an unsecured one two, an encrypted one (JWE) five. Wherever it sits: the value positions, a bare
line, pytest's diff line, and after a scheme the value positions do not know (`Authorization: vapid
t=<jwt>, k=<key>` and `WebPush <jwt>`, the header the kernel's push code mints). The header bound
is what keeps the rule linear (below); a header beyond it is longer than any JOSE header an
installation meets, and a token carrying one is still taken whole in a value position, on a bare
line and on a diff line by the generic rule and its dotted rest.

A value pytest has already cut is a piece of a value. At its default verbosity pytest ellipsizes the
operands of a failed `==`: the repr keeps its head and its tail, 11 to 13 characters each, joined by
`...` (`'sk-ant-api03...2c3d4a1b2c3d4'`, `['0123456789a...456789abcdef']`); its saferepr of a local
under `--showlocals`, of a traceback's arguments and of the operands on a `+  where` line keeps 118
characters of the repr on each side of the `...` (117 of a quoted string, at its default maximum of
240); the short test summary cuts a message at the terminal's width with `...` appended; and a long
explanation (over 8 lines or 640 characters) is truncated with `...` appended to its last line, so a
diff line can end mid-token in `...`, its marker and sign before a piece of the value. unittest
shortens a long container repr with `[N chars]` in place of the middle and keeps up to 41 characters
beside it after a common prefix it leaves whole when that is 22 or fewer, so 63 at most. A known
prefix against either ellipsis is a truncated key, whatever follows, when 1 to CUT_HEAD_MAX (120)
token characters sit between the prefix and the cut: every cut a tool makes at default verbosity
leaves a head within that bound. A wider head (pytest's saferepr at `-v` keeps 1198) is a run the
format rule takes on its own (20 characters or more, 30 for `AIza`), and every format rule takes a cut
against its run and the run after the cut in the same match, so a cut key is one marker whatever the
width of its head and wherever it sits, quoted or bare (a line a test or a child process prints itself
ends the tail with a newline or a space, not the quote the fragment rule below needs; until the format
rules took the tail, such a line showed it). The bound is there so a prefix inside a long run that
never reaches a cut costs a bounded scan (an unbounded head made the scrub quadratic: 80 seconds on
a 200 KB line of repeated `hf_`, which is what the tests/test_env_value_redaction.py timing case
guards). What a format rule cannot take whole is a body of characters its key does not have. A
Hugging Face token is `hf_` and 34 letters (gitleaks' rule is `hf_(?i:[a-z]{34})`, and every token that
rule is tested against is letters only); the `hf_` rule here takes letters and digits, wider than that
on purpose: narrowing it to letters would exclude nothing more (what ends a match in an identifier is
the `_` it carries, not a digit), and a token that did carry a digit would show. RunPod publishes the
`rpa_` prefix and nothing of the body (checked 2026-09-06; gitleaks has no rule for it), and the
`rpa_` rule is the same class. A body with `_` or `-` in it, whole or cut, is therefore taken up to
that character under either prefix. Past the bound the rest of such a head shows in bare text, and in
a quoted repr too once 20 letters and digits precede the `_` or `-` (with fewer the format rule
fails, the whole head is a fragment between the quote and the cut, and the fragment rule takes it);
within the bound the cut rule's head class takes it. That shape is no Hugging Face token; a real
RunPod key carrying `_` or `-` would be the reason to widen the `rpa_` class, and the whole key in
bare text, not the cut one, is what widening would fix first. The class stays narrow so an
`hf_`-prefixed identifier of 20 characters or more (`hf_hub_download_to_cache_dir`) is not redacted.
A cut JWT is the same with dotted segments in its head and tail
(`'eyJ<header>.eyJ<payload>...<payload>.<signature>'`, and unittest's `['eyJ[35 chars]<rest>']`,
whose head is the prefix alone). Its header is bounded at JWT_HEADER_MAX, as the whole token's is,
wherever the cut falls: a cut inside a header of up to that many characters past `eyJ` is the cut
rule's match, and a cut past the header (a payload cut deep, after a header of any width within the
bound) is the JWT rule's, which takes the cut and its dotted tail the same way. What neither takes is
a cut token with more than JWT_HEADER_MAX characters between `eyJ` and the first dot or the cut,
whichever comes first — a header past the bound with the cut anywhere after its first JWT_HEADER_MAX
characters (a cut inside such a header within them is the cut rule's match: the bound is on the head,
not the header): in a quoted repr the fragment rule takes its head and its tail as two matches, in a
value position the generic rule takes the head and the tail shows, and in bare text the header shows
— whole, with the cut and the tail, when the cut is inside it; up to its dot when the cut is in the
payload, where the payload's own `eyJ` (a JSON payload begins with one too) is the cut rule's match
with the cut and the tail. No enumerated tool leaves a head of that width (pytest's widest default
cut leaves 118 characters; its `-v` cut of 1198 lands past any real header), so such a line is a
hand-made one. A run of 8 or more token characters against an ellipsis, with a
quote or another ellipsis on its far side, or with a diff line's marker and sign before it and the
ellipsis ending the line, is a fragment of an unknown-format value when it has a digit, or when it
has a lower-case letter and an upper-case one anywhere after its first character (a base64 tail can
lack a digit); its dotted rest rides along. So a Capitalised word (`'Connecting...'`) and a
single-case identifier (`'test_a_long_...'`, `'deadbeef...'`, `'ABCDEFGHIJKL...'`) stay, and a
camelCase or PascalCase name (`'SessionStart...'`, `'HookEndToEnd...'`), a cut ISO date or timestamp
(`'2026-09-06...'`, the head of `'2026-09-06T1...6+00:00'`) and an identifier with a digit
(`'python38...'`) are redacted. That is a readability cost in a cut repr, taken on purpose: a
PascalCase name's letters are a shape a base64 tail without a digit takes for one 8-character
fragment in 25 (one in 200 at 13), and a digit-bearing run is the shape of a hex tail, so an
exclusion for either would pass fragments of a key.
