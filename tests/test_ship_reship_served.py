"""T215: a kernel restart between an attachment's ship and its ack must not wedge the upload.

The wedge (verified on main before the fix): file bytes ride the ws as base64 dropFile and
complete on a droppedPath ack sent back on the SAME socket. pendingShips is in-memory and
nothing on romp:wsup ever re-shipped or failed it — so a kernel restart in the ship→ack window
left the chip pulsing forever, and a send held by the ship gate ("Wait for the upload") waited
on an ack that could no longer arrive: message plus attachment parked with no error.

The fix, both faces:
  * same-page reconnect (the served dashboard): every pending entry retains its encoded payload
    and re-ships on romp:wsup — the exact kernel-is-back event, never a timer. The ack/nack
    echoes the client's shipId, so a duplicate ack from a re-ship race retires exactly the chip
    that asked, and a stray twin is DROPPED instead of attached to the active tab. Since the fold
    that brought the reload core (T265: a kernel-served page owed itself a reload when the kernel
    serving it restarted; since the 2026-09-16 ruling it offers a newer build's reload instead and
    reloads only when the user accepts, or on the forced path the wedge below uses), the chat pane
    also holds that reload while any ship awaits its ack or a send is held behind the ship gate
    (T272: render.ts wraps the shim's window.__rompPaneBusy and answers
    'upload' / 'held-send'; the core asks it before firing), and tells the core when the last ack
    lands or the gate clears (endReloadHoldIfIdle, __rompReload.ended()), so the heal runs first and
    the reload follows it on that event. Without the hold the reload landed about 1.7 s after the
    relaunch and took the payload with it. The notices raised when the LAST ship retires (a nack: the
    file was not saved, the held message not sent; the ack of a held send on another tab) would die
    with that reload, which follows in the next task, so the page keeps the toasts on screen in this
    tab's sessionStorage on the core's pre-reload hook, with the core's release note when its 60 s
    backstop fired, and the fresh page shows them again once (render.ts persistNoticesForReload,
    reload-notices.ts liveNotices / releasedNotices / keepReloadNotices / takeReloadNotices).
  * reload (the VS Code pipe reloads its webview on kernel reconnect): the payload dies with
    the page, so the ship NAMES persist beside the drafts and the next load says LOUDLY what
    was lost — never a silent vanish.

The guards here:
  * SourcePins — runs everywhere, CI included: the wiring above, pinned in the sources (the
    webview-side twins live in ui/webview/pending-attach.test.ts).
  * ServedWedge — the executed guard: boots the hermetic kernel, opens the real /chat page,
    SIGSTOPs the kernel so the dropFile is shipped on a live socket that will never answer,
    holds a send behind the ship gate, SIGKILLs and relaunches the kernel — and asserts the
    reconnect re-ships, the thumbnail lands, and the held send fires, and only THEN the page reloads
    itself onto the relaunched kernel's boot id, with no loss to announce. Plus the regression leg:
    a normal ship+send against the restarted kernel behaves exactly as before. Skips LOUDLY
    when the extension deps or a playwright browser are absent (CI installs no browsers).
  * NackNoticeSurvivesReload: the same wedge with the relaunched kernel unable to save the
    re-shipped file. Its nack retires the last pending ship, which lets the held reload (the
    offer the changed build stood, accepted by the driver as the user's Reload; 2026-09-16)
    fire on the next task, and the notice the nack raised (the file was not saved, the
    held message not sent) must be shown again by the fresh page, once.
  * LabKernelEnv, which runs everywhere: a lab kernel's environment is built from names (kernel_env,
    which every lab that boots a kernel uses), never from a copy of the runner's: a live kernel's
    exports planted in the runner (ROMP_MANAGER_PID, ROMP_SERVE_HOST, its sid) are absent, the run's
    floor and the lab's own names present, and the lab kernel's postal bus is a port of its own that
    is never started.
  * RelaunchEnv, which runs everywhere: the relaunch stanza the lab writes to its cfg.json for the
    driver's relaunch of the kernel carries only the names the relaunched kernel needs (a name
    planted in the lab kernel's environment as a probe is absent, and so is a ROMP_TESTS_ name, the
    run's own, wherever it came from; a live session's identity and manager pid in the runner reach
    neither the lab kernel nor the file; the lab's own names, the run's private roots and its git
    isolation present); the served legs check the written file itself.

All fixtures synthetic.

# kernel serves (ROMP_SERVE_HOST) and, with no ROMP_POSTAL_PORT of its own, dialled the machine's postal bus at boot
# (kernel.py's _ensure_postal_bus), or on a machine with none started a detached bus nothing stops. From the runner a
# lab kernel takes PATH (bin/romp-kernel runs under `env python3`) and HOME, the XDG_* names (kernel/credentials.py
# resolves the service.env default under XDG_CONFIG_HOME) and, of what tests/conftest.py sets for every child of the
# run, TMPDIR, the private root conftest gives the run's temp files, GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL and
# GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM, which keep the kernel's boot-time git (the build sha, the release-tag probe) off the
# developer's git configuration, and the four ROMP_ names of its floor the lab does not set itself:
# ROMP_SERVICE_ENV_FILE and ROMP_SERVICE_ENV (no real service.env), ROMP_CLAUDE_BIN (no real claude CLI) and
# ROMP_CLI_SCOPE (no systemd-run). The lab's own names go over those: its roots and serve seams; the three network
# switches off (ROMP_MODEL_CATALOG, ROMP_UPDATE_CHECK and ROMP_PRICE_FEED: tests/conftest.py floors the catalog and
# the price feed in the RUNNER's environment, which a kernel built from names never inherits, so the lab sets both
# itself, and two served labs open the Token usage view whose build starts the feed fetch); and a postal bus of its
# own: ROMP_POSTAL_PORT at a free port with ROMP_POSTAL_PEERS=0 and ROMP_POSTAL_CLIENT_ONLY=1, so the kernel's
# boot-time ensure starts nothing there (client-only applies in the legacy singleton scheme alone,
# postal_service.is_client_only).
# The environment the driver hands the kernel it relaunches rides the lab's cfg.json, a file, so it is narrowed once
# more (relaunch_env) to the ROMP_* and XDG_* names, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, PATH and HOME and the three conftest names:
# never anything else a lab put in its kernel's environment, such as the probe the served legs plant, and never a
# ROMP_TESTS_* name, the prefix tests/conftest.py exports the run's own names under (ROMP_TESTS_SYSTEM_TMPDIR): no
# kernel reads one, so a lab kernel's environment carries one only if the lab put it there, and the file never does.

class NackNoticeSurvivesReload(_ShipLab):
    """The reload the user accepts from the offer a changed build stands (a restart of the same code owes no reload since
    2026-09-14, and since 2026-09-16 a changed build is offered, never taken) follows the LAST pending ship's retirement:
    retirePendingShip ends the hold
    (endReloadHoldIfIdle, __rompReload.ended()) and the core fires on the next task. The nack that retired the ship
    raises its toast in the same handler, after the hold ended, so the notice (the file was not saved, the held
    message NOT sent) was appended one task before the page went: never read, and the fresh page's loss toast had
    nothing to say (shipsInFlight was already empty). A failed attachment and an unsent message went unannounced.
    Now the core's synchronous hook keeps the toasts on screen in this tab's sessionStorage and the fresh page shows
    them again once. The drops path is made a regular file before the relaunch so the re-ship's save fails and the
    kernel nacks it (_save_dropped_file); the old page latches its toast in sessionStorage, which survives the
    reload. A toast wearing the ephemeral mark is on screen too (a stand-in with warnToast's shape, since the lab has
    no unreachable host for render.ts to raise its own), and the fresh page must not repeat it."""
