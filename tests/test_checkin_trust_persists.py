"""A check-in handshake must not undo the trust you set (the user 2026-07-29).

Symptom: a remote was set to trusted, over and over, and kept coming back as directed — its mail
quarantining again minutes later. The setting was not being forgotten by the store; it was being
OVERWRITTEN. checkin_apply rebuilt the peer's row from scratch on every handshake with a hardcoded
"trust": "directed", and the handshake repeats once per tunnel INCARNATION: every reconnect, tunnel
respawn and kernel restart on the checking-in machine.

The mismatch is invisible from the sending end, which is why it read as a store that forgets: the level
a peer DECLARES comes from its own row, so the sender kept displaying "they hold yours: trusted" while
the receiver was quarantining. A re-check-in is the same relationship reconnecting, not a new one.

Synthetic only — placeholder hosts/ports/tokens, hermetic temp STATE, no ssh.
