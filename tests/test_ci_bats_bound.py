"""The bats step of CI carries a per-test bound from bats itself (.github/workflows/ci.yml, 2026-09-16).

The macOS bats leg (a manual dispatch) was cancelled at the job's 35-minute ceiling on every run, nameless:
the job annotation says only that the maximum execution time was exceeded, and the TAP stream stops at the
last test that finished. BATS_TEST_TIMEOUT is bats-core's own bound (since 1.8, in the pinned 1.11.1 and in
Homebrew's 1.14.0 alike): a background sleep, then pkill or ps on the test's children, and the test's TAP
line ends "# timeout after Ns", so a hung test fails in minutes and is named. No coreutils timeout, which the
macOS image lacks. Source pins, as tests/test_ci_workflow_concurrency.py: no YAML library in the test deps."""
